Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care



 BLITZER 
That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the [0] *** battlefront *** (CONFLICT).
Let's get an update now on casualties on Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Military officials say 39 Americans have been [10] *** killed *** (LIFE) in [7] *** combat *** (CONFLICT), 9 more by
friendly [6] *** fire *** (CONFLICT) or an accident. Britain reports 6 of its troops have been
[11] *** killed *** (LIFE) by combat, 19 more in nonhostile action and 2 [9] *** deaths *** (LIFE) have not been

officials say 420 civilians have been [13] *** killed *** (LIFE) and about 4,000 [14] *** injured *** (LIFE).
U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner. Seven
Americans remain prisoners of [15] *** war *** (CONFLICT) in Iraq and 15 Americans are listed as
missing in action. One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue of
Private First Class Jessica Lynch. Judy, in the next hour, on our special

brother who is in the Army, her younger sister who wants to be in the
Army, just around the same time as Jessica is going to be [16] *** arriving *** (MOVEMENT) at
Ramstein, the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment.
That's all coming up on our special edition of "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS" at
the top of the hour. Judy, back to you.


 WOODRUFF 
All right, Wolf, and we will be watching. Thanks very much. Well, at the
Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of
the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting
force. Let's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war
picture as they see it. Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs
correspondent is with us now. Hello, again, Jamie.


 JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SNR. MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't
seen for awhile. First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN,
the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S.
troops, that taking place in Najaf. Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter
than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really
seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S.
troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut. They met lighter than
expected resistance. But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close
in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that
so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his
commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical
weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 MAJOR GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, JOINT CHIEFS, VICE DIR. 
We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a
coup de mains, or anything like that. So, in regard to that, we are
paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground. They may
just suddenly be effective on the ground. Additionally, their ability to
use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically. We
believe they have the capability now. Clearly, as we threaten the core of
the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the
likelihood of them using those weapons goes up.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

 BLITZER 
In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi
Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a
several-pronged attack. The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through
Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard,
and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad. At the same
time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris River
crossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the
combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was
supposed to be providing defense down there. At the U.S. Central Command
briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, General
Vincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approach
Baghdad. He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of
the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the
regime is gone." Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin
to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago. Is there a
chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the
strength of what's left of the opposition?


 MCINTYRE 
Well, they might be. And that might be a good thing. They are taking it
very cautiously. No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of
this could be ahead. Could be urban combat. Could involve chemical
weapons. Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad.
Could be a very dangerous time. They also are careful to point out that
even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean
every single person has been killed. Simply that its combat effectiveness
has been eliminated - Judy.


 WOODRUFF 
We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact,
they said let others do that. Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon.

Iraq Warns of Unconventional Counter Attack Tonight; Saddam Sends 
Message Suggesting he is Alive, Still Defiant



 BLITZER 
[4] *** Attacking *** (CONFLICT) on the ground and calling in air strikes, Kurdish fighters and
U.S. troops have dislodged stubborn Iraqi soldiers at a key bridge in
northern Iraq. Iraqis pulled back on the road to Mosul as CNN's Jane
Arraf reports from the battlefield.

A few miles further to Mosul, Kurdish militia and their flags [6] *** speeding *** (MOVEMENT) to
a town [7] *** abandoned *** (MOVEMENT) by Iraqi forces. After a day of [11] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT), the Iraqis
were [12] *** driven back *** (MOVEMENT) five kilometers, about three miles down the main road
west towards Mosul from the Kurdish city of Erbil. Soldiers were Kurdish,
but the special forces calling in air [5] *** strikes *** (CONFLICT) on Iraqi positions were

to the Americans are calling in air strikes. The Peshmerga are just down
the road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on to
the bridge. (voice-over): That blast turned out to be a rocket-propelled
grenade, but there's plenty of artillery and mortar [16] *** fire *** (CONFLICT) to come.

it's a small part of this [9] *** battle *** (CONFLICT) for the bridge just behind us. These
were lying on the ground next to the truck. Somebody picked them up. It's

really tell from it is that he was 27 years old. And a snapshot from when
his life was still ahead of him. Other evidence of a hurried retreat amid
the smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask. Military documents.
Notebooks with verses from the Koran. Kurdish fighters planted their flag
and left it waving in the smoke of the bombed-out Iraqi truck. The
village of Manguba (ph), just 32 kilometers, about 23 miles from Mosul is
now in Kurdish hands. One Kurdish soldier did the honors of tearing up a
poster of Saddam Hussein. Not just the poster, but the frame and
cardboard backing as well. They've been waiting a long time. Jane Arraf,

 BLITZER 
Thanks very much. Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters,
our embedded journalists. And one of them, not from our CNN, but from a
very close friend of all of ours, Michael Kelly, paid that price. The
first American embedded journalist to have gotten killed in covering this
war. We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of "WOLF
BLITZER REPORTS." Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you.


 WOODRUFF 
Thanks, Wolf. And we'll be watching. Michael Kelly, of course, with
"Atlantic Monthly," and a columnist for the "Washington Post." Well, at
least three U.S. service members were killed today in an apparent suicide
bomb attack at a checkpoint near the Haditah Dam northwest of Baghdad.
Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At last
report, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 others
by friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 British troops, in all who
have been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly
fire or accidents. The official Iraqi casualty figures remain the same
this day, including more than 400 civilians killed, Iraqi authorities
say. And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been
captured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher. We
know that seven Americans are known to be held as prisoner of war in
Iraq. Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action. Well, funeral
services were held today in Colorado for 21-year- old Marine Corporal
Randall Kent Rosacker. He was killed in action in Iraq. His story is
especially poignant. His father is a navy commander. He received word of
his son's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to
returned home from an extended deployment. The Iraqis promise an
unconventional attack on U.S. troops tonight. Do they mean guerilla
warfare, as in Vietnam? We're going to ask our military analyst. That's
coming up.

But they also discussed the Middle East and, as well, getting the
Northern Ireland peace process started up again. It has been said that
Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist. I guess you can say in the
past tense. His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to
support those claims. The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basra
is just one example. ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and he
takes us on a tour of Basra's chamber of horrors.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 BILL NEELY, ITN REPORTER (voice-over) 
Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a state of terror, and this is where it's
planned and perpetrated, the headquarters of his secret police, this one
in Basra. No British soldier has been here yet. Today, as I walked in, I
met Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly. What was to
follow was a horrific education in terror and torture: in the smoking
basement of the bombed building, a warren of cells. Here, prisoners were
tortured.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
Yes, of course.


 NEELY 
People died.


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE

there's plenty here that we simply cannot show you. In this block, it was
men over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here.

given no trial, no voice, cry out. On the ground, I found a book called
"The Psychology of Interrogation," as if the men who worked here for

And, as we listened to John King's report, we can tell you that President
Bush has just -- his plane has just landed at Andrews Air Force Base,
just close to the Washington area, the president having flown back to the
United States from that meeting in Northern Ireland in Belfast with the
British prime minister, Tony Blair. You just heard John reporting about
it. They primarily talked about the war in Iraq, the aftermath of Iraq.
But they also discussed the Middle East and, as well, getting the
Northern Ireland peace process started up again. It has been said that
Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist. I guess you can say in the

support those claims. The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basra

[translator speaking] today, i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by
the united states against iraq's old government. [translator speaking]
first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i'm
suspending the iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of
certain commitment necessary for iraq's reconstruction. [translator

american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that
contributed to humanitarian reconstruction. [translator speaking]
soon, at the u.n. security council, the united states, great britain
and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions
imposed by the united nations. [translator speaking] the regime that
the sanctions were directed against no longer rules iraq. [translator

the united states took steps to cut off financing for the organization

expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.

 Mark 
Um,  to hi- -- yeah, I- -- I think he did what he thought -- was right for
his people.  I- I- -- I would say he was a good leader -- for- -- for, uh,
his people.  And as far as our involvement there, should be as little
as possible.  Just let them do -- what they,  you know, what they're

mm, by the way I am from Arab origin,  so I also have, uh,  uh, the

is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the
[0] *** conflict *** (CONFLICT) between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot
of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh-
For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and

Israel and another one for Palestine.


 Mark 
Right.


 Ali 
So, if we -- -- eh, if United States,  Bush,  Israel ((told)) th- the
solution or to, uh,  to make the decision,  eh,  I think this will
solve -- the problem.  The -- unfortunately what happens right now- -- The
-- for example, which is -- little bit toward it's- it's interest.  For
example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the
United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an
invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting
any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval.  She
did wha- what she want.  But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian
[2] *** conflict *** (CONFLICT) there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until
now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I
believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh,
became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President
Bush time.  For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at
that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I
believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh,
the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they [4] *** met *** (CONTACT) together
in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve
this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this
((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.  Most of the big problems between the two
parties,  they negotiated everything almost and there is -- there
were, like, final steps that have to be solved.  But, uh, I think if
there was, like,  the, um,  the same policy has to be followed after
Clinton.  I think -- everything would- -- -finished then- -- the -- I think
United States -- went to another direction and, eh,  they forgot about
this problem right now.

more or less obligated -- to continue,  uh, the process that was already

That is not his priority, I don't think.

Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row


JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP)

Indonesia will delay the [19] *** execution *** (JUSTICE) of six convicts including an
Indian on [13] *** death *** (LIFE) row after five of them [1] *** appealed *** (JUSTICE) to the Supreme Court
for a second review, prosecutors said Thursday.

"If we [0] *** execute *** (JUSTICE) them now we can't bring them to life again should
their [14] *** appeals *** (JUSTICE) for a review be granted," said Antasari Azhar,
spokesman for the attorney general's office.

The Supreme Court rejected earlier [2] *** appeals *** (JUSTICE) for a case review from
five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one [3] *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) for
a review.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and
asked for a speedy [20] *** execution *** (JUSTICE). Five of them are Indonesians [5] *** convicted *** (JUSTICE)
of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad
Chaubey.

"We are talking about someone's life or [4] *** death *** (LIFE) so we have to be very
careful," Azhar said.

A convict can file a case review or [6] *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) for presidential clemency
only after the Supreme Court upholds a [7] *** sentence *** (JUSTICE) imposed by a lower
court.

Apart from those [8] *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) of murder, 16 people are on death row for
drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch
citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin.

Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe [9] *** sentences *** (JUSTICE),
including [18] *** death *** (LIFE), for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an
increasingly serious problem in the country.

Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of
[10] *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the
death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other
punishments.

Amnesty opposes the [15] *** death *** (LIFE) penalty for any crime.

Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia, where the last
[12] *** execution *** (JUSTICE) was carried out in May 2001 of two men [11] *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) of a
[16] *** murder *** (LIFE) in 1989. It was the first execution for five years.

A police [17] *** firing *** (CONFLICT) squad enforces the penalty.

Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife's work in divorce case


BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut (AP)

[1] *** Retired *** (PERSONNEL) General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch is seeking
work-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakes
[0] *** divorce *** (LIFE) case.

The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago, shortly
after Suzy Wetlaufer  _  then editor of the Harvard Business Review 
_ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while
working on a story about him.

In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York,
Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior
partner in the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in New York. He
also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley
Welch's personnel file by Shearman & Sterling, a prestigious
corporate law firm where she worked before she married [2] *** Welch.
 *** (LIFE)
Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspo[7] *** ndence
between *** (CONTACT) his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law
firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of
becoming[4] ***  a partn *** (PERSONNEL)er.

Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits,
retireme[3] *** nt plan an *** (PERSONNEL)d other compensation paid to [8] *** her. *** (TRANSACTION)

Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine.

A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will
remain confidential.

Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details
about perks Welch received as part of his retireme[9] *** nt package *** (PERSONNEL) from GE
at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage.

The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K.
Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business
dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.

Webb also said details of the breakdow[6] *** ns of the  *** (LIFE)Welches' previous
marriage[5] *** s were li *** (LIFE)kely to come up, and cited reports of alleged
extramarital affairs by both.

Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a
financial affidavit. That document detailed monthly outlays of some
$51,000 for upkeep on a half-dozen houses scattered from
Massachusetts to Florida, more than $52,000 for gifts and nearly
$9,000 for food and drink, among other expenses.

Spurned by U.S. over human rights, Indonesia turns to Russia for arms


JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)

The dictator Suharto has [3] *** fallen *** (PERSONNEL), the constitution has changed, the
media was unshackled, democratic [1] *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) held, and East Timor
freed. After Sept. 11, 2001, Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S.
President George W. Bush's global war on terror.

Yet, Washington maintains a 12-year ban on arms sales to the world's
most populous Muslim nation with the aim of curbing human rights
abuses still happening despite momentous political change.

Frustrated, Jakarta's generals are looking elsewhere to replace
antiquated arsenals.

Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels
to Moscow to seek the Kremlin's help in modernizing her increasingly
obsolete 300,000-member armed forces.

She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie for
lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector, long dominated by American
and British resource giants.

Although opposite ends of the Earth, Indonesia and Russia have some
basic things in common.

Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic
populations. Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they
fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of
authoritarian rule.

Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse by
endemic corruption. And, currently, both have opposed the U.S.- led
war on Iraq.

Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says
Megawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21
will touch on the Iraq crisis.

But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the
two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms
sales.

Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can no
longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing for
easy infiltration by extremists.

Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated the
threat of terrorism in Indonesia. And, broad opposition to the
U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant
Islamists.

``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely
unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S.
policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Jakarta.

Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.

Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under
Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were
severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.

The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main
weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in
the 1980s.

In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian
troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor.

In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces
laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence
referendum.

The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand
the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia.

Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and
a prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to be
repealed.

So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer
training program. But that's far from enough for Indonesia's
generals.

``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that
restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth
it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. ``So they
want to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters and
other hardware.''

Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a
customer.

Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons, including 10,000
Kalashnikov assault rifles, a squadron of naval Mil-2 helicopters and
a dozen BTR-80A amphibious carriers for its marines.

Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30
years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra,
Borneo and Papua from air attack.

``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.

Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's
impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such
as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.

The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons
of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier
dogfighters.

Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets
that were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers already
in the Indonesian inventory. But neighboring Malaysia's success in
integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuaded
them otherwise, Sudarsono said.

If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it
is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged.
Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secular
state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and
religious militancy.

What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic
ambitions.

Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to
dlrs 203.5 million in 2001  _  the last year for which statistics are
available. Analysts say this can only grow.

The real concerns, though, are in the petroleum sector.

Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russian
companies a toehold in Indonesia's oil and gas industry, long
dominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP.

two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms
sales.

Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can no
longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing for
easy infiltration by extremists.

Last year's Bali [0] *** bombings *** (CONFLICT), which [2] *** killed *** (LIFE) 202 people, illustrated the
threat of terrorism in Indonesia. And, broad opposition to the
U.S.-led [4] *** attack *** (CONFLICT) on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant
Islamists.

``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely
unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S.
policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Jakarta.

Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.

Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under
Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were
severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.

The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main
weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in
the 1980s.

In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian
troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor.

In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces
laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence
referendum.

The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand
the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia.

Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and
a prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to be
repealed.

So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer
training program. But that's far from enough for Indonesia's
generals.

``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that
restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth
it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. ``So they
want to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters and
other hardware.''

Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a
customer.

Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons, including 10,000
Kalashnikov assault rifles, a squadron of naval Mil-2 helicopters and
a dozen BTR-80A amphibious carriers for its marines.

Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30
years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra,
Borneo and Papua from air attack.

``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.

Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's
impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such
as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.

The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons
of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier
dogfighters.

Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets
that were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers already
in the Indonesian inventory. But neighboring Malaysia's success in
integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuaded
them otherwise, Sudarsono said.

If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it
is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged.
Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secular
state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and
religious militancy.

What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic
ambitions.

Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to
dlrs 203.5 million in 2001  _  the last year for which statistics are
available. Analysts say this can only grow.

The real concerns, though, are in the petroleum sector.

Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russian
companies a toehold in Indonesia's oil and gas industry, long
dominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP.

U.S., Britain drafting resolution limiting U.N. role in Iraq to
humanitarian relief


LONDON (AP)

The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that would
give the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but not
peacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W.
Bush's administration said Friday.

Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and
humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American,
British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops
to the British and Polish sectors to [6] *** create *** (BUSINESS) an international
stability force, the official said.

The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping with
refugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarian
assistance, the official said. The United States and Britain agree on
all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official
said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.

U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has no
interest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute to
the political resuscitation of the country.

``Take the question of security. I don't think the U.N. would want to
take on that,'' Annan said. ``There has been a suggestion that the
U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also
not the case.'' What the United Nations could contribute beyond
humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.

The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from
other U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convened
[1] *** conference *** (CONTACT) of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan's
post-Taliban government.

U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld [2] *** discussed *** (CONTACT) the resolution
with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on
Friday as Rumsfeld [3] *** returned *** (MOVEMENT) from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and the
Persian Gulf region. Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. would
play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution
outlining that role.

Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport,
also did not mention the draft resolution.

``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward'' in Iraq, Hoon
said.

International stability forces will be [4] *** sent *** (MOVEMENT) to Iraq as soon as
possible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when that
would be. Those troops will work to restore and maintain order and
supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and
electricity and delivery of food and medical aid.

The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine,
Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said.
Representatives of those countries will [13] *** meet *** (CONTACT) with British officials
May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each
country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or
Polish command.

The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of American
troops. While that portion is likely to consist of a military
division  _  about 20,000  _  the troop strength of the other two
sectors has yet to be determined, the official said.

The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war
commander, Gen. Tommy Franks.

At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augment
rather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, the
official said. The stability forces will focus on providing security
and humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting out
leftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armed
elements in Iraq.

Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countries
contribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will be
needed inside Iraq.

Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security
force left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies that
vehemently opposed the [14] *** war *** (CONFLICT) in Iraq.

Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATO
authorization for that action, the official said. Requests for such
authorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planning
committee, which does not include France, the official said.

The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a
[7] *** conference *** (CONTACT) Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16
countries, mostly NATO members. Other countries including the
Philippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send other
help such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposal
teams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.

The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take into
account ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq,
the official said. For example, although ethnic Kurds are the
majority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also large
numbers of Kurds within Baghdad.

Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stability
operation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of
political, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said.
Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to [8] *** donate *** (TRANSACTION)
money for the effort.

Rumsfeld also [9] *** met *** (CONTACT) Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an American
ally in the Middle East. Defense officials say Jordan provided key
help in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. special
operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being
fired at Jordan or Israel.

Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.

U.S. LIKELY TO WAIT, REGROUP BEFORE ATTACKING BAGHDAD


04-03-03 02:16:00EST

By EDWARD EPSTEIN

c.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

WASHINGTON _ Having [5] *** punched through *** (CONFLICT) severely depleted Republican
Guard divisions that formed Baghdad's outer defensive ring, U.S. Army
and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi
capital's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of
the U.S. [4] *** assault *** (CONFLICT). Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20
miles from Saddam Hussein's capital. Bet`fow Central Command chief
Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _
whether to [6] *** rush *** (MOVEMENT) into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has
gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the [3] *** war *** (CONFLICT) can be
won without paying the price of street-to-street urban [7] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT).

``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult [8] *** fight *** (CONFLICT)
ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``We
are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''

Instead of an all-out [23] *** assault *** (CONFLICT), analysts expect the United States to
follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city
of Basra. They are likely to [27] *** mount *** (MOVEMENT) small probing patrols into the
city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance.

If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could
[9] *** rush *** (MOVEMENT) into the city. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and
Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry
Division, which will soon start [10] *** moving *** (MOVEMENT) north from Kuwait. While they
wait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are
within the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.

``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you see
problems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' said
Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was
assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.

``Before going in (with a full [28] *** assault *** (CONFLICT)), you have to decide if it's
worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of
Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he
said.

The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi
civilians, which makes the British experience around Basra
instructive, the analysts said. The British have been outside the
city of 1.5 million for more than a week. Thousands of refugees have
[11] *** fled *** (MOVEMENT) the city, apparently providing information to the British that
has led to [12] *** raids *** (CONFLICT) on military and Baath Party sites in the city.

``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key
regime centers of power in Baghdad and [13] *** attack *** (CONFLICT) them without having to
[14] *** fight *** (CONFLICT) into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily
[15] *** war *** (CONFLICT) report.

U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in
control of his forces, might like a bloody [16] *** battle *** (CONFLICT) in Baghdad because
such [17] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) could cause heavy U.S. [18] *** casualties *** (LIFE). His last hope for
survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such
[19] *** losses *** (LIFE) and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would
allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad.

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said
the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive
Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city.

``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guard
divisions before that final [29] *** battle *** (CONFLICT), and only have to face perhaps
30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the
task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.

While two guard divisions have apparently been [20] *** smashed *** (CONFLICT), there are
three others in the Baghdad area. A sixth remains in northern Iraq.

Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from
the regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.
This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.

``The Republican Guard has taken a massive [21] *** hammering *** (CONFLICT) at every level
and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the
brigade level,'' he said.

The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many
experts feared such [22] *** attacks *** (CONFLICT) as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad. Korb,
who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never
reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein
tried to use them.

But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show
the world he never had such weapons and that Bush [24] *** invaded *** (CONFLICT) for no
reason other than aggression.

The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from
the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are
trained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, they
would lose much of the technological advantage of their air
supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because [1] *** bombing *** (CONFLICT) in a city
can cause large civilian [2] *** casualties *** (LIFE).

However, Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide, straight
boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Our
forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But there
would be lots of [26] *** casualties *** (LIFE) on all sides,'' Korb said.

Need Active Angel Investor for guaranteed capital deal

 Need Active Angel Investor for guaranteed capital deal 

I am the head of a company that [0] *** raised *** (TRANSACTION) an angel round of
financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never
physically met initially. Without sounding pretentious, he read
my business plan and on the strength of it, wired me money a
few weeks later

I am currently reviewing investor interest for a guaranteed
motion picture capital fund (YES INVESTMENT IS 100%
PROTECTED AND SECURED IN THE EVENT FILMS DO NOT PERFOM
USING INNOVATIVE FIANCING HEDGE) for the following

I am looking for an active investor/partner for several films
including a Russian "Goodfellas" meets "Once Upon A Time In
America" and several high end studi-esque horror films where the
principal of an investment is secured 100% exclusive of performance.

There is ripe window of opportunity right now for independently
financed film examplified with the recent success of such films
as Napolean Dynamite (made for 250,000, sold for 5 mil, made
50 million at b.o.), Garden State, Open Water, Maria Full of
Grace, Motorcyle Diaries, SAW (made for 750,000-made 60 mil.)
and others.

the CEOS and execs of companies such as Fred Smith of FEDEX,
Norman Waitt Of Gateway, Jeff Skoll of Ebay, Roger Marino of
EMC, Marc Turtletaub of The Money Store, Marc Cuban/Todd
Wagner, and others have all [1] *** parked *** (TRANSACTION) their money in film ventures
and deals similar to ours,

I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his
company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently [2] *** exited *** (PERSONNEL)
executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle
of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get
into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment
reasons.

While it seems there are other situations that are similar to mine,
i feel that because I do offer a 100% capital guarantee of
principal on investment, my business model and risk
minimization offers more of a clear cut exit strategy than just a
pie in the sky deal.

I am looking for someone who can help me get the financing and is no
frills, reliable, and visionary when it will come down to it.

Someone who has an extensive network in alternative investments, hedge
funds, private equity, and an old-school network. I am not looking for
a boiler room cold caller, but someone that can present my deal to 5-10
guys and make it happen. email to filmhe...@aol.com

Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis

Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was [0] *** elected *** (PERSONNEL) USCF
President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles. Immediately after she
[1] *** took *** (PERSONNEL) office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank,
zero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed
prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.

Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz [2] *** walked *** (MOVEMENT) into the USCF
Offices in New Windsor and immediately [3] *** fired *** (PERSONNEL) 17 staff members. John
McCrary resigned from the board as a result.

Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz
fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that
she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.

It took six weeks before the USCF [5] *** paid *** (TRANSACTION) the guaranteed prizes the prize
winners had won at the US Open.

I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long
time. The USCF did not have zero money in the bank. It had $85,000 in
another bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to any
malfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate
bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that
account. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the
accountant herself.

When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was
planning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was
closed out. Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed
by the USCF for scholastic tournaments. At scholastic tournaments, no
cash prizes are [6] *** paid *** (TRANSACTION). However, in adult tournaments, the players
expect to [7] *** receive *** (TRANSACTION) their prizes, and to receive them immediately.

For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF,
the accountant was immediately [8] *** fired *** (PERSONNEL).

Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known,
it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.
Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might
not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.

 Frank Niro comments on the Aug 2003 so-called crisis 

Yes, Sam, you are correct. And I knew about it also.

I also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) for
inventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension
&health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. that
I was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about. I knew that they
would get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting in
understatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004. And, of course, that
is what happened. I just had no idea that the new Board would see it as
leverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.

Not only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loan
on the building to bridge the move. But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 points
and interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary. We also had a buyer
for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a
commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville.

Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be
facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere. To make the staff
cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary
&Camaratta's departures.

When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and
clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome. I sat in New Windsor all
weekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed light
on the situation. It is no coincidence that the employees let go included
substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including
(remarkably) the employee of the year!

You can read all this in my book coming out next summer.

Thanks for seeing the truth for a change.

Best wishes to all,

Democrats Finally Getting it Right on Abortion?



 Scott 
 2004-12-23T14:49:00 
This is absolutely amazing news. Finally, the Democrats are finally
realizing that the American people support the rights of unborn children
and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values
that at least half of this country possesses. Of course, I'm sure the
Democrats would also like to start winning [1] *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) again. From the Los
Angeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of
abortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal
struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader
array of voters.

The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic
National, particularly between two leading candidates: [2] *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Vermont
Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and [3] *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Indiana Rep.
Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound
from its losses in the November [4] *** election *** (PERSONNEL) unless it shows more tolerance
on one of society's most emotional conflicts. No Democrat with any
respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's name
again. The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his home
state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism.

Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which
[0] *** gives *** (TRANSACTION) a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've
got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.

Results from the last few [5] *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) suggest that wouldn't be such a
good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.

Worst Neighbor in the World



 Scott 
 2005-02-05T19:54:00 
We've all lived next to some pretty undesirable people at one point
or another, but I can't imagine anyone being worse than this. A Colorado
judge ordered two teen-age girls to [0] *** pay *** (TRANSACTION) about $900 for the distress a
neighbor said they caused by giving her home-made cookies adorned with
paper hearts.

The pair were ordered to [3] *** pay *** (TRANSACTION) $871.70 plus $39 in court costs after
neighbor Wanita Renea Young, 49, filed a [1] *** lawsuit *** (JUSTICE) complaining that the
unsolicited cookies, left at her house after the girls knocked on her
door, had triggered an anxiety attack that [2] *** sent *** (MOVEMENT) her to the hospital the
next day.

Taylor Ostergaard, then 17, and Lindsey Jo Zellitte, 18, paid the
judgment on Thursday after a small claims court ruling by La Plata
County Court Judge Doug Walker, a court clerk said on Friday.

The girls baked cookies as a surprise for several of their rural
Colorado neighbors on July 31 and dropped off small batches on their
porches, accompanied by red or pink paper hearts and the message: "Have
a great night."

The Denver Post newspaper reported on Friday that the girls had
decided to stay home and bake the cookies rather than [4] *** go *** (MOVEMENT) to a dance
where there might be cursing and drinking. Zebra Report has a picture of
the good-intentioned girls. Maybe delinquency does pay off better.

Do people never learn from the mistakes of others?



 Mark Backer 
 2004-11-17T11:07:00 
For those of you not from around these parts, Linda Schrenko WAS the
State of Georgia's Superintendant of schools. It seems that in recent
years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent
her time [2] *** stealing *** (TRANSACTION) over 600 grand in Federal Education funds. She used it
for various things, but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a
facelift.

Here's a link to the story:

link

One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her [0] *** indictment *** (JUSTICE)
in a fur coat.

Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin
drug [1] *** trial *** (JUSTICE) of the mid 90's? You never EVER show up at court, especially
facing [3] *** indictment *** (JUSTICE) for [7] *** stealing *** (TRANSACTION) large sums of money, wearing a fucking
FUR COAT!! Fake or not, you look like you're rubbing the common man's
nose in it.

Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't [6] *** get *** (JUSTICE) any actual jail
time, I hope the [4] *** fine *** (JUSTICE) she pleads to is at least as much as what she
stole. Otherwise, she's learned nothing.

Remember when Michael Milken got busted, he was not forced to give up
his secret accounts, and when the [5] *** fine *** (JUSTICE) of 600 million was levied...HE
PAID IT!! Hell, at his zenith, that's what he made in ONE YEAR!!

"Um...how much, your honor? 600 large? Yeah, lemme just get my
checkbook out of my diamond encrusted briefcase."

Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't
see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad. Because it's
people like Schrenko for which jails were specifically designed...

Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care



 WOODRUFF 
As coalition forces push ahead in their [2] *** march *** (MOVEMENT) toward Baghdad, they have
encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala. But
American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key
factor in the [0] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) there. And to the south, British forces continue
their [4] *** attack *** (CONFLICT) on targets around Basra. ITN correspondent Tim Ewart
reports.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 TIM EWART, ITN CORRESPONDENT 
These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, [3] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) near Karbala,
southwest of Baghdad. They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard,
his finest soldiers. But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule
the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior. U.S.
commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force.


 BRIG. GEN. VINCENT BROOKS, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND 
We will approach Baghdad. The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of
the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is
gone.


 EWART 
To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra. British troops

A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oil

warplanes and the distant surge of air [11] *** strikes *** (CONFLICT). This territory is within
easy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk. The
oil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, a
harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable. Iraq's precious

Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad



 WOODRUFF 
Thanks very much. An investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue in
southern Iraq after a gruesome discovery by some British troops. Tim
Ewart of ITN News reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned Iraqi
military base.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

 TIM EWART, ITV NEWS (voice-over) 
It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it. The remains
of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board
coffins. British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi military
base on the outskirts of Azubayr. The evidence suggested it was the scene
of appalling atrocities. The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken,
and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform. It's not
clear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not from
this [0] *** war *** (CONFLICT).


 UNIDENTIFIED MALE 
You come to expect everything in [1] *** war *** (CONFLICT) [2] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT). The coffins were there. It

Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalog
of photographs of the dead. Most had [3] *** died *** (LIFE) from gunshot wounds to the
head. Others were [4] *** mutilated *** (LIFE) beyond recognition, their faces burned and
swollen. Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose-
built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets.
Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead. Forensic
specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of
what happened here and when. (on camera): Today's discovery seems to
provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime.
Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here.
But when they do, British soldiers believe, more horrors will come to

One of the toughest jobs in Iraq right now is that of the military
doctor. CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has been traveling

 SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) 
Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story. Some we'll never

these stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never look
the other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching.
They are often the first faces the injured see, be they Iraqi or

set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile

Their stories could be seen in the shrapnel [7] *** wounds *** (LIFE) of rocket-propelled
grenades and bullet [8] *** wounds *** (LIFE) from semi-automatic weapons. The operations
are on their hands, abdomen and face. Two of the Marines, too far gone.
For many of the survivors, that news is the most difficult to handle.

thanks for having me.


your journey, particularly to southern iraq, what is evoked
there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history
of this regime. give us your insights as to what you think
the future holds.


do you mean if i start with the past?


not at you will. not at all i.


not much of a trip. i wasn't up the sharp end. i wasn't
taking risks. i wasn't in a position that my dear friend
was in when he was [1] *** killed *** (LIFE) outside bagdad airport but i had
long thought and i was in iraq in the previous [2] *** war *** (CONFLICT) that
really all the talk that had been about the rush to [3] *** war *** (CONFLICT),
the push for war, the drive for war, all that propaganda,
was essentially nonsensical because in 1990, saddam hussein
made the only self criticism. he said, i could either
[4] *** invade *** (CONFLICT) kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon.
maybe before the weapon and then later he said, oh, i
should have got the nuclear weapon before i [12] *** invaded *** (CONFLICT). he was
right about that. but that means that he inaugurated at
that point like a dozen-year's [5] *** war *** (CONFLICT) where the united states
could be criticized for doing too little and acting too
slowly but all we're arguing about lately is to do with
those that should have been finished in '91 when it could
have been finished. should have taken the side of the
rebels then. taken the risk of supporting a shiite
[6] *** insurrection *** (CONFLICT) at that point. helping the kurds, removing the
regime.


absolutely.


we'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we'd done
that. that seems to be the core of the argument.


as you point out, of course, for the fact of the matter is,
the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal
from power ultimately. the mistakes of the united states,
again, as you point out, norman schwarzkopf making a peace,
permitting helicopters to fly.


still hurts me to read this. the little town i was in this
southern iraq, as far as i got, i can't boast of further,
is where the talks took place. we have the transcript of
the meeting. they say, okay, we have lost this round. do
you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be
able to transport things? and he says, yeah, that's all
right. they ask again, are you sure they mean that? they
can't believe the luck. they use the gunships to [7] *** kill *** (LIFE), we
think, not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern iraq
and trying to do that to the kurds, as well, so it was a
knife edge. and it's not just been wise after the event, i
believe, to say that there was an argument in realtime
between the bush administration members. mr. cheney's the
only one i know that changed his mind. most of those that
took the view at that time, think until recently they were
correct in saving saddam hussein.

 B 
Well.  I don't know.  I you know what? I think -- I think Rudy Giuliani
was a great mayor -- for nine eleven.


 A 
Right.


 B 
I don't think he was a great mayor the whole time he was a mayor.


 A 
Well, I I'm a New Yorker, and I got to tell you that I I think nine
eleven I I think -- basically made him.  Other than that, I think he was
a little too decisive.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
Uh not I shouldn't say decisive, too divisive.


 B 
Yeah, I think he


 A 
As far as -- the race relationship in this city. You know, it doesn't
take much to to please -- the other side. And that and that's what
government is all about.


 B 
no, it doesn't.


 A 
And he -- he wasn't -- he wasn't too much of a good uh


 B 
He he would've gone out as a mediocre mayor had it not.  And I but
even even saying that I can't begrudge him. But he did a great job in
the crisis. Some people do better in crises.


 A 
Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly, exactly, I I think that nine eleven made him
and


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
and at that point in time, he wanted to stay on, which was sort of
sort of ridiculous.


 B 
And if if if I don't think the rest of the country knows that, because
they don't know what he did before nine eleven, because they don't pay
any attention.


 A 
Eh -- Exactly.  Exactly, of course, you're right, you're quite right.


 B 
And -- I think that if he did get a government agency,  it would have to
be one that was having crisis a lot of times I mean,  he would just
have to devote himself to that. If he could just do that, it would be
fine.


 A 
It's a good point.


 B 
But if he gets if gets into a lot of policy making and stuff that for
other things, you know,


 A 
Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I I I I know I one of the


 B 
I don't know.  Probably would be a good attorney general, he did that


 A 
it could very well, he did a good job, you're right, he probably could
follow in what's his name's footsteps.


 B 
you know.  I think I think the cases that he picks and chooses
probably I wouldn't necessarily put on top of the list, but he did
seem to


 A 
Right.


 B 
prosecute everybody evenly.


 A 
Yeah. That much I think we can we can probably agree with. He will
probably do that evenly.


 B 
Yes.  Right.


 A 
I you know who I thought would have made a great, uh well I I know you
guys had your own political uh struggles in Jersey.


 B 
Right.  Yeah.


 A 
Um and uh


 B 
It's a soap opera.


 A 
oh it certainly was, I I saw the footage. I


 B 
Right, right, all of a sudden. I'll tell you this. Within one day,
everybody I met said -- oh, McGreevey, sure, I knew that.


 A 
Oh really?


 B 
That became the national thing to say in Jersey, and in Jersey. Like,
everybody knew it, I'd be like, you did not. Nobody knew that.


 A 
In Jersey?  Yeah I think I was -- I think I was -- I was on a cruise, and
I put on the television uh when I got in at the six oh clock news, and
bingo, there he is, uh resigning as Governor of uh New Jersey. I said,
you've got to be kidding me.


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
But uh -- I thought he would have made a name for himself.  um -- I I
can't think of anyone anyone that anyone else out there that um -- that
warrants. I mean, you know, you just


 B 
No.


 A 
pick people who I think will uh -- have the experience in government.
Well not in, not in government, but in the private sector. Um -- who are
responsible, and um -- put them in a position to lead.


 B 
Well,  Yeah, I think uh -- apparently -- the President likes people that
are the same philo- -- political philosophy as him, and I'm not sure
I mean I think he just needs some other voices in there, but


 A 
That's right.


 B 
I don't know if it'll happen. It's


 A 
That's a good point. Well, I


 B 
or not. He he needs some liberals in there and he needs some -- Ralph
Nader people, and some Green Party people, and some, just some.


 A 
Well I I think more conservative, what do you call them? Conservative
uh -- um -- um what do you call them? Uh conservative uh -- more -- oh bloody
he-


 B 
Ideologues?


 A 
I yeah well I guess you could look at it that way, yeah.


 B 
eh


 A 
Um.  Um.  I didn't particularly like the the tone about the the
religious uh -- side of -- the that election. I I thought that was a
little crazy.


 B 
Yeah, I think pretty wack.


 A 
If it's one thing we need to be careful about, it's separating the
Church from


 B 
Exactly, I'm a pastor, and that bothers me.


 A 
and -- uh -- Yeah.  Oh I I'm glad to hear some uh an actual pastor who
says that. I I I think that we need to make sure that that that


 B 
Yeah.


 A 
that stays the way it is. I think it serves everyone well.


 B 
Well, for one thing, it it ends up as the uh -- government officials are
those seeking office, and uh -- preaching and teaching to people, and
that's my job.


 A 
Right.  I agree.


 B 
That's what I do. You mind your stuff, I'll tell my people what we're

Over a year ago.

 Winnette 
Yes.  Yep.  Um,  I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the whole
story for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that he
was involved anything to do with it. Then they found out that he was
having an affair on her.  And -- then of course when they were
investigating him -- he tried running.  Dyed his hair and -- grew out a
mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash.


 Irvin 
Wow.


 Winnette 
So I mean,


 Irvin 
(())


 Winnette 
he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.


 Winnette 
of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt.


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.  So is he is he still um -- in prison now?


 Winnette 
Yeah.  And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will [12] *** get *** (JUSTICE)
the death penalty, or life in prison.  So that's what's is up in the
air right now.


 Irvin 
What state is this in?


 Winnette 
California.


 Irvin 
It's in California.


 Winnette 
And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the
twenty-second of November,  but they had an issue happen with -- one of
the jurors -- so it's postponed everything.  But,  actually they were
trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into
effect,  that if in fact a mother was [2] *** killed *** (LIFE), and pregnant,  um -- for
there to be a double murder [13] *** charge *** (JUSTICE).


 Irvin 
Oh, uh-huh.


 Winnette 
And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that
charge if they were -- [20] *** found *** (JUSTICE) guilty on both charges.


 Irvin 
Uh-huh.


 Winnette 
And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he [14] *** got *** (JUSTICE)
first degree murder and -- um and then [15] *** got *** (JUSTICE) manslaughter on the baby.  So
he didn't [16] *** get *** (JUSTICE) both first degree murders.


 Irvin 
What's the difference?


 Winnette 
Where -- Um,  I guess because he didn't [3] *** murder *** (LIFE) the baby directly.


 Irvin 
Oh.


 Winnette 
I'm thinking maybe was the difference.  And because of the the [17] *** charge *** (JUSTICE)
on the baby, they couldn't automatically [18] *** give *** (JUSTICE) him the death penalty,
but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever


 Irvin 
What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that?


 Winnette 
and -- well he still denies everything.  He has never admitted


 Irvin 
((Still does))


 Winnette 
to do it.  um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he
wanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father,
didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child


 Irvin 
So he didn't have any other children?


 Winnette 
that was -- No, that was going to be their first.  And actually I don't
even think they were [19] *** married *** (LIFE) that long, maybe a year or two.

Shiites openly mark Mohammed's birthday in Iraq as lawlessness still
reigns = (PICTURES) =


BAGHDAD, May 19 (AFP)

Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time in
decades Prophet Mohammed's birthday, as continuing anarchy and chaos
threatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war-ravaged
country.

Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqi
government were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromise
could be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctions
on Iraq.

Thousands of Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main
mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam's founder Prophet
Mohammed.

Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims,
were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam
Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.

The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the
northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam,
calling for good government.

"No to injustice," "No to occupation," "No to Israel," "Yes to
Islam," chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform.

Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi, who last week threatened violence against
"sinful" women, alcohol vendors and cinemas showing "indecent" films,
offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq "the land of
imams... land of Islam."

The demonstration came as Iraq's top US overseer Paul Bremer began
his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the
country.

In his frenzied first seven days, the telegenic Bremer repeatedly
promised to restore the law and order that [0] *** crumbled *** (BUSINESS) along with Saddam
Hussein's regime nearly six weeks ago.

But despite issuing a host of tough decrees, Bremer has failed to
stem the rampant crime and street [3] *** violence *** (CONFLICT) plaguing the country.

Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an
announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs
since the end of the [4] *** war *** (CONFLICT), ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the
street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence.

In Baghdad, almost all the police stations have been destroyed or
looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9. Only
two have so far reopened, and they have no equipment whatsoever.
Baghdad's top police job remains vacant.

And a trip to Baghdad's looter market only bears witness to the fact
that criminals are ruling the roost in the post-Saddam era.

Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of
theft that followed the collapse of Saddam's regime, the traders deal
in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons.

Jalal Jamil, a 45-year-old jewellery store owner, said the situation
just keeps getting worse. "The Americans encourage people to steal
because when looting happens right under their noses they do
nothing," he said.

Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier US
timeline on forming a government in Iraq, but US-led coalition
officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track.

"We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would
be wrong to do that precipitously," said a source at the Organisation
of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which is
administering post-war Iraq.

Officials from Iraqi groups that met with Bremer last week have said
that he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to give
them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few
weeks.

"We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but
we told them: 'You won't be directly elected, you won't have any
direct experience of government," the source said.

"'Of course you will have input into the government but, since you
are not directly elected, it would be a nonsense for you to have
direct executive power,' the source said.

"The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointed
oligarchs in power," the source said.

The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for
internationally-supervised elections in Iraq.

Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on
May 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman daily
that elections should be held under international supervision.

An interim government should create an election code and laws to
clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly, that
would draw up a constitution, Pachachi said.

A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new
government, the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily.

On the diplomatic front, a top Russian official said Monday that the
UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US-British draft
resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition
control for at least a year.

"An updated text of the document may already be published today and
may be put to a vote this week," Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov
told ITAR-TASS news agency.

Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution,
which diplomats have been revising since the United States, Britain
and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago.

Russia "will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to
be," he said.

With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq, Russia
has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the
resolution.

Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help
Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in
recovering looted ancient artefacts.

Lawyer reprimanded for Chiluba's failure to appear in court


LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)

The lawyer of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was
reprimanded by a Lusaka magistrate when his client failed to appear
in court on theft [0] *** charges *** (JUSTICE) Friday.

Chiluba, who is [2] *** accused *** (JUSTICE) of stealing millions of dollars while in
office, did not appear at the Lusaka magistrates court as scheduled
because he has filed an [4] *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) to have case heard at a higher court.

Chiluba's lawyer, Chifumu Banda, told the court he had advised
Chiluba not to appear in court Friday, following an agreement with
the prosecution that the [5] *** case *** (JUSTICE) be postponed for a month while the
appeal is considered.

``The matter is before this court and whether an [6] *** accused *** (JUSTICE) person
wishes to request for an adjournment or they wish to be absent for
any other reason, such a request must be done here,'' said Magistrate
Christopher Shacifwa.

He said lawyers could not decide on postponements between themselves.

Shacifwa ordered Chiluba to appear in court on May 16.

Chiluba faces 65 counts of theft including that of 15 billion kwacha
(US$3 million) in cash from the Zambia National Commercial Bank in
Lusaka.

He has denied the allegations.

France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a step toward
U.S. goal


UNITED NATIONS (AP)

France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions
targeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal of
ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country's economy.

The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. [2] *** war *** (CONFLICT)
against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W.
Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and
its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.

France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal
at a Security Council [0] *** meeting *** (CONTACT) where members heard a briefing by chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged
views on potentially divisive [1] *** postwar *** (CONFLICT) issues.

The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq
while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq's 1990 [5] *** invasion *** (CONFLICT) of
Kuwait. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to
deliver them.

Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposed
the war. But de La Sabliere said before the [6] *** meeting *** (CONTACT) that Security
Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''

Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at all
opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N.
inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of
mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.

Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss
it.''

At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council was
to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq's 24 million
people.

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase
out the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited
quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and
compensation to victims of the first Gulf War.

``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of
this program,'' de La Sabliere said.

This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the
weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.

These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctions
but the U.N. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over, control of
Iraq's oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.

Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors to
have access to all sites and people in Iraq. He said he told the
council that he believes the world would like Iraq's disarmament
confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the
country for over 10 years.

The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive
for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams
to Iraq to search for illegal weapons.

``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for
disarming Iraq,'' U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday when
asked whether U.S. teams would work with U.N. inspectors.

He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the
atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more
freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking
them the questions.''

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find
practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the
work of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that
the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.''

He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended
``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisioned
U.S. and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions could
be lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place,'' he said.

In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that before
the war, the U.S. and Britain appeared to have used ``shaky''
intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove Iraq
had banned weapons.

Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that U.S. intelligence
failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buy
uranium from the West African nation of Niger. He told reporters at
the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake''
uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''

U.N. inspectors went back to Iraq for the first time in four years in
late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{
months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N.
international staff, including the inspectors, to leave Iraq just
before the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them to
return.

Annan also said Tuesday in Austria that Iraqis should be in charge of
their own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``the
U.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on the
U.N. role in Iraq in the ``not too distant future.''

This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the
weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.

These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctions
but the U.N. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over, control of
Iraq's oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.

Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors to
have access to all sites and people in Iraq. He said he told the
council that he believes the world would like Iraq's disarmament
confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the
country for over 10 years.

The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive
for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams
to Iraq to search for illegal weapons.

``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for
disarming Iraq,'' U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday when
asked whether U.S. teams would work with U.N. inspectors.

He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the
atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more
freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking
them the questions.''

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find
practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the
work of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that
the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.''

He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended
``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisioned
U.S. and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions could
be lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place,'' he said.

In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that before
the war, the U.S. and Britain appeared to have used ``shaky''
intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove Iraq
had banned weapons.

Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that U.S. intelligence
failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buy
uranium from the West African nation of Niger. He told reporters at
the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake''
uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''

U.N. inspectors [4] *** went back *** (MOVEMENT) to Iraq for the first time in four years in
late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{
months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N.
international staff, including the inspectors, to [10] *** leave *** (MOVEMENT) Iraq just
before the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them to
return.

Annan also said Tuesday in Austria that Iraqis should be in charge of
their own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``the
U.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on the
U.N. role in Iraq in the ``not too distant future.''

France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a step toward
U.S. goal


UNITED NATIONS (AP)

France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions
targeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal of
ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country's economy.

The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. war
against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W.
Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and
its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.

France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal
at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged
views on potentially divisive postwar issues.

The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq
while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to
deliver them.

Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposed
the war. But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security
Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''

Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at all
opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N.
inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of
mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.

Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss
it.''

At another closed-door council [7] *** meeting *** (CONTACT) later Tuesday, the council was
to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq's 24 million
people.

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase
out the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited
quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and
compensation to victims of the first Gulf War.

``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of
this program,'' de La Sabliere said.

This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the
weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.

These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctions
but the U.N. role in Iraq now that the [8] *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) is over, control of

confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the
country for over 10 years.

On the eve of a [1] *** visit *** (MOVEMENT) to the Saudi capital, Foreign Minister

``We have quite a substantial security presence at the Australian

Australia is one of Washington's staunchest allies. Canberra sent
troops to fight in the war on terror in Afghanistan and alongside

New Zealand also has no immediate plans to close its Saudi embassy.

On Tuesday, Saudi security officials said three suspected al-Qaida
militants were arrested in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, in sweeps following
the near-simultaneous suicide attacks on three residential compounds
on the outskirts of Riyadh on May 12. The bombings killed 34 people

wounded nearly 200 others.

Earlier this week, Saudi and U.S. officials said they had new

The Palestinians want land to live on, while Sharon wants no
Palestinians living on the land. When the world finally
grows the balls to criticize Israeli terrorism, we'll see
peace. But as long as "criticism is anti-semitism" is the
mentality, don't act surprised that the Palestinians object
to the Lebensraum (a/k/a settlements) and Israeli terrorism
(bombings, shooting farmers in their fields, bulldozing crops,
destroying schools, shooting children, etc. etc. etc.).

George Carlin said it best: "Let's not have a double standard,
one standard will do just fine." Apply the same standards to
Israel that we apply to the Palestinians.

OT: Republican election standards



 gould0...@aol.com 
 30 Jan 2005 10:06:08 -0800 
 OT: Republican election standards 

Here on the left edge of the country, we have a unique perspective on
election standards.

In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major
forces vying for control of the country opts out. A few people will
turn out and [5] *** elect *** (PERSONNEL) somebody. It is hailed as the greatest triumph of
democracy since the defeat of Imperial Japan.

In Washington State, our governor's race may be undecided for months to
come. Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in
our state constitution, the democratic candidate [1] *** won *** (PERSONNEL) by a margin of
less than 200 votes. With roughly three million votes cast in the race,
the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some
such microscopic amount. For all intents and purposes it was a tie- but
somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it
was the demos.

The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too
unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the
population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some
election is better than no [2] *** election *** (PERSONNEL), and it's a great day for
democracy!"...........are [3] *** suing *** (JUSTICE) to overthrow the results of the
governor's [0] *** election *** (PERSONNEL) is Washington State because there were some
"errors" in the process. (They hollered "fraud" until they got to
court, but unable to find any evidence with which to substantiate that
charge they have backed down to "errors".)

So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an [4] *** election *** (PERSONNEL) is
just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free
and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a
human error rate of 0.0000001 percent.
In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but
also "perfect". (Of course, the Republicans would have thought the WA
State [6] *** election *** (PERSONNEL) *was* perfect, had their candidate
held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally
cleared).
Funny how the standards change, and so easily, depending on agenda.



 Bert Robbins 
 Sun, 30 Jan 2005 13:52:34 -0500 
 Re: Republican election standards 


We have seen our state's standards. Keep recounting the votes until you get
the results you want and if you need to go "find" some more votes in a
warehouse, in a box, hidden behind some other boxes.

    

This is too funny. The ones that are "opting" out are in one of three
protected classes within Iraq. The protected classes are Kurd's, Sunni's and
Women.

    

only vote that ends in a tie is where both sides have the exact same
number of votes. This didn't happen in Washington State. It took multiple
recounts before the vote tabulation was determined to be credible by the
Democrats.

    

Wasn't it King County that had "counted" more votes than registered voters.
Please explain how this happens. It seems that the evidence of irregularity
in the voting process is extremely apparent.

    

Yes, it is funny isn't it?

 Re: OT: Republican election standards 


I'm a Democrat, a liberal and probably whole bunch of other labels that you
can pin on me. I'm always glad to see people gain the opportunity to change
their government from a dictatorship to a democracy. Everyone, everywhere
should have the basic right to elect their[7] ***  gove *** (PERSONNEL)rnment.

The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results
are going to be tainted and questionable. Think about this objectively
(forget the US is involved), if a foreign country invaded ano[8] *** ther an *** (CONFLICT)d set up
elections, [9] *** wouldn't  *** (PERSONNEL)a reasonable person question the validity of the
election results? Let's assign some names. Say it's 1942, and the German
occupiers in Holland have set up elections w[10] *** ith Dutch *** (PERSONNEL) candidates. Well, not
really candidates, but political parties -- you'll be told who the
candidates were later. Would you say the results are valid?

Even if you, John H, believe the US held impartial elections i[12] *** n Iraq, d *** (PERSONNEL)on't
you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid, or least
suspect?

If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a
success by any measure," that's good enough for me.

Not even Chris (Kerry's my man) Mathews could find any real fault with
the outcome. Our soldiers weren'e even close to the polls. Hell, they
couldn't even see the polls in most places, so the intimidation
bullshit is just that. Even Brian Williams, when questioned by Chris,
had to admit that he saw nothing to show US intimidation. (You could
tell it was killing Brian to have to admit that!)

Of course,you probably know better since you were there, right?

Here, go read something from people who are there:

If you look closely, you'll even find some negatives to gloat over.

Sorry about my hard ass attitude!

The US soldiers were purposely kept well away from the polls during
the time the polls were open. They were the outer of three concentric
security rings, with the Iraqi police and Army occupying the closest
two rings.

I watched a lot (but not all, of course) of the news on most of the
different channels, staying up until 5 am (like a real dummy!). I
didn't see one instance of US soldiers at polling places. I *did* see
a lot of Iraqi soldiers. Except for the US flag on the shoulder and
the different weapons, they look pretty much the same. Hell, I noticed
that some of the US soldiers were carrying AK's in one place!

Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino's season touchdown record today with

overtime. I was happy to see Manning break the record, as last week he
decided to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when
he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a
touchdown. Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of
all time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.

On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White, [0] *** died *** (LIFE) of
heart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43. White played a

The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.

Not Wise to Attack Floridians



 Scott 
 2005-02-24T12:07:00 
From the St. Pete Times : Some Florida legislators want to give
people the right to [0] *** shoot *** (CONFLICT) an attacker in a public place.

A House committee voted Wednesday to allow people to shoot to [7] *** kill *** (LIFE) in
self-defense if they are [1] *** attacked *** (CONFLICT) "in any other place where he or she
has a right to be." Sponsored by Rep. Dennis Baxley, an Ocala
Republican, the bill (HB 249) passed 13-0.

State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause
"[2] *** death *** (LIFE) or great bodily [3] *** harm *** (LIFE)," such as [4] *** firing *** (CONFLICT) a gun at a person or a
vehicle.

Florida courts consider [5] *** deadly *** (LIFE) force a last resort and have held that
a person being attacked has the "duty to use every reasonable means to
avoid the danger, including retreat, prior to using deadly force."

But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public
place "has no duty to retreat."

"Law-abiding people should not be told that if they are attacked,
they should turn around and run," NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer told
lawmakers. "This bill gives back rights that have been eroded and taken
away by a judicial system that at times appears to give preferential
treatment to criminals."

Baxley held up a stack of more than 800 e-mails from Floridians who
he said have [6] *** written *** (CONTACT) him to support the bill. He said 62 House members,
a majority, have endorsed his bill, and supporters include Attorney
General Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs, police
chiefs and police officers.

Rep. Jeff Kottkamp, R-Cape Coral, said the bill reminded him of a
sign he saw on a constituent's house while campaigning door-to-door.
Kottkamp said the sign, next to a doorbell, showed a smoking .44-Magnum
handgun and the words: "We don't dial 911." This is great news for
Florida gun carriers because now to defend yourself you don't have to
first make sure a "duty to retreat" is impossible. Currently, if one's
life is threatened he/she must make sure it is impossible to escape
before using deadly force on an attacker.

2Slick pointed me to a article at In Iraq For 365 . This is a great
blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly. On Sunday he wrote of
two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when
the Mosul [0] *** bombing *** (CONFLICT) occurred. The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments
throughout the Marez dining facility. One piece of shrapnel [1] *** sliced *** (LIFE)
through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for
survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.

Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special

Americans. No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's

brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while
visiting Iraq. When I meet the people working alongside the United
Nations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are trying
to bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courage
and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority
of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom, then I know that
we are doing the right thing. . . .

And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq, but
the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the
intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying
to make this country better.

Now what should our response be as an international community? Our
response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've
got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.
I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do. . .
.

Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in
Iraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand
how precious what has been created here is. And those people from that
electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new
Iraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone,
they've got to travel in from outside. They do not know at any point in
time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation,
even death, and yet they carry on doing it. Now what a magnificent
example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.

2Slick pointed me to a article at In Iraq For 365 . This is a great
blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly. On Sunday he wrote of
two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when
the Mosul bombing occurred. The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments
throughout the Marez dining facility. One piece of shrapnel sliced
through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for
survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.

Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special
forces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound,
creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red. They
moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry. After
they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer,
the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other
wounded without regard for their safety.

When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody
who could talk was questioned about their health. When the medics came
to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody
else was. When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, "this was
our duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other." Even the
Americans. No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's
