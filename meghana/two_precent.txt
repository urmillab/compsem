New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?



 BEGALA 
Well, we'll debate that later on in the show. We'll have a couple of
experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then. Even as the
secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last
month, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men  *** landed *** (MOVEMENT) on
American shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge
now leads. Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the
hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?
Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician. He
lost an  *** election *** (PERSONNEL) to a dead man. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge
is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice
presidency. And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is
yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones
University. Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's
really important, like political consulting.


 NOVAK 
Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional
politician based on that is somebody who is  *** elected *** (PERSONNEL) to public office. Now
in your administration, the Clinton administration, there were these
members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional
politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno,
Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros,
Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mention
former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the great
professional politicians of all time, Bill Daly.


 BEGALA 
And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country. And these
bozos let four armed Cubans land on our shores when they're trying to
make a high terrorist alert. Our president has put homeland security in
the hands of failed Republican hacks.  *** Hire *** (PERSONNEL) professionals, Mr. President.


 NOVAK 
So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
Department and the Pentagon...


 BEGALA 
Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.


 NOVAK 
Just a minute, let me finish my sentence, please. It's OK to  *** put *** (PERSONNEL)
Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department
if they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right?


 BEGALA 
No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.

(CROSSTALK)

 BEGALA 
John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was.


 NOVAK 
Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to
run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was
no. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement today
that he would not be the 10th candidate for the  *** nomination *** (PERSONNEL). Why not?
Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or
Dennis Kucinich. He explained he could better spend the next two years on
homeland security, the economy and judicial  *** nominations *** (PERSONNEL). I guess that
means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President
Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years.


 BEGALA 
God, I hope so. that's all I can say. I love Senator Dodd. He would have
brought a lot to the race. He brings a lot to the Senate and to the
debate. And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights. Well,
the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in
January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February. In all, two
million Americans have  *** lost t *** (PERSONNEL)heir jobs under President Bush so far, not
to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic
team. Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion. It could swell to as
much as $500 billion if we go to  *** war *** (CONFLICT) in Iraq. Mr. Bush apparently is
untroubled by this fiscal collapse. One of his aides tells the current
issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"
Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3
trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund. You
know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he
borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know.


 NOVAK 
Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even
if you won't recognize them. Number one, there is absolutely no
relationship between the deficit and unemployment. They don't go
together. And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia.
There just isn't one.


 BEGALA 
Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts.


 NOVAK 
There never has been one.


 BEGALA 
There has been one for 60 years.

New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?



 NOVAK 
Welcome back. Orders went out today to  *** deploy *** (MOVEMENT) 17,000 U.S. Army soldiers
in the Persian Gulf region. The army's entire first Calvary division
based at Fort Hood, Texas, would join the quarter million U.S. forces
already in the region. We're talking about possibilities of full scale
 ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) with  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine. He's now
national director of Win Without War, and  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Congressman Bob Dornan,
Republican of California.


 BEGALA 
Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this
 ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have
been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Our
president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're a ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)e,
Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms
program who  *** defected *** (PERSONNEL) for a time. And gave us a whole lot of information
and then went home and his father-in-law  *** killed *** (LIFE) him. Bad move. But while
he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lot
of information. Well, our president told us that information proves that
the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true. But what we just
learned this week from "Newsweek" magazine which got a hold of the
debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995. Why
hasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from
"Newsweek"?


 DORNAN 
I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed. The fact that this
guy was such an idiot to  *** go *** (MOVEMENT) back and let his father-in-law  *** kill *** (LIFE) him shows
he wasn't the most stable of people. But the things that...


 BEGALA 
Good point. But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told
him. Why do we learn from "Newsweek?"Should he level with us?


 DORNAN 
Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT).
Any rational person hates  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). Bush isn't sitting in that White House not
thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clinton
suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that  *** died *** (LIFE), 18 on the 3rd of October
and Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I  *** visited *** (CONTACT) all their families. I
was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, what
 *** trips *** (MOVEMENT) to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the
law of unintended consequences it pertains to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). I am shook over the
aftermath. But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler. He will  *** blow *** (CONFLICT) a
city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do
it.


 NOVAK 
Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) a
nation goes to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). And so I would like you to take a look at the
CNN/"USA TODAY"/Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to  *** go *** (MOVEMENT) to
Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Take a look at it. Favor 59%,
opposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior
had in  *** getting *** (MOVEMENT) the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) started.
That's pretty good support isn't it?


 ANDREWS 
Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this. I mean, listen, this is the
oldest trick in the book. You can have a general question like this that
could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the
top of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what they
think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask them
about going and not just a  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), Bob, but an  *** invasion *** (CONFLICT) and occupying for up
to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most
distable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel about
getting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you start
telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us
story. They're not coming for ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)d and telling us what the risks are, what
the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us
getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to
this  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learn
about this occupation, the less they support it.


 DORNAN 
Tom, you know what liberals want. They don't want a smoking gun, they
want a smoking city. The Clinton people all say...


 BEGALA 
That's going to have to be last  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), unfair and unfortunate as that is, I
am sorry, they're telling us we're out of time. Former Congressman, Bob
Dornan from California...


 DORNAN 
You're not going to get a smoking city.

Death toll in Philippine  *** blast *** (CONFLICT) could hit 30: radio ATTENTION - ADDS

DAVAO, Philippines, March 4 (AFP)

At least 19 people were  *** killed *** (LIFE) and 114 people were wounded in
Tuesday's southern Philippines airport  ***  *** blast *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), officials said, but
reports said the  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) toll could climb to 30.

Radio station DXDC placed the  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) toll at 30, without giving a
source for the figure, which officials could not immediately confirm.

The Davao Medical Center, a regional government hospital, recorded 19
 ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE)s with 50  *** wounded *** (LIFE). Medical evacuation workers however said the
injured list was around 114, spread out at various hospitals.

A powerful bomb tore through a waiting shed at the Davao City
international airport at about 5.15 pm (0915 GMT) while another
explosion hit a bus terminal at the city. There were no reports of
 *** injuries *** (LIFE) in the second  *** blast *** (CONFLICT).

"It's a very powerful bomb. The waiting shed literally exploded,"
said Vice Mayor Luis Bongoyan, speaking to local radio station

Television footage showed medical teams  *** carting *** (MOVEMENT) away dozens of
wounded victims with fully armed troops on guard.

Many of the victims were shown with hastily applied bandages, and
teams of nurses and doctors were seen in packed emergency rooms
attending to the wounded.

Sotheby's, Christie's pay 40 million dollars over antitrust suits


NEW YORK, March 11 (AFP)

The world's most powerful fine art auction houses, Sotheby's and
Christie's, have agreed to  *** pay *** (TRANSACTION) 40 million dollars to settle an
international price-fixing scam, Sotheby's said.

The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of  *** suits *** (JUSTICE)
by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the
United States, it said in a statement.

"Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and
Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars," said Sotheby's, which
operates in 34 countries.

The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both
auction houses to be dropped.

Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to  *** pursue *** (JUSTICE) further
cases in foreign courts.

The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States
between January 1, 1993 and February 7, 2000, and sellers between
September 1, 1995 and February 7, 2000.

Similar claims over US-based auctions were  *** settled *** (TRANSACTION) in an agreement
struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars.

In December 2001, a Manhattan jury  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) Sotheby's main
shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a
price-fixing agreement with Christie's.

Four months later, the billionaire was  *** sentenced *** (JUSTICE) to one year in
prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing, which
prosecutors said had  *** cost *** (TRANSACTION) clients of both firms 400 million dollars.

Christie's was not  *** prosecuted *** (JUSTICE) in the United States after its
management agreed to testify against Sotheby's and provide documents
needed to prove fraudulent intent.

Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control more than 90 percent of
the fine art and antiques market.

Sotheby's said it would record the 20-million-dollar settlement as a
special charge for 2002. It would be funded in two payments of 10
million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval.

Consider yourself lucky that you had to wonder about it. I became familiar with

The Palestinians want land to live on, while Sharon wants no
Palestinians living on the land. When the world finally
grows the balls to criticize Israeli  *** terrorism *** (CONFLICT), we'll see
peace. But as long as "criticism is anti-semitism" is the
mentality, don't act surprised that the Palestinians object
to the Lebensraum (a/k/a settlements) and Israeli  *** terrorism *** (CONFLICT)
( *** bombings *** (CONFLICT),  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) farmers in their fields, bulldozing crops,
destroying schools,  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) children, etc. etc. etc.).

George Carlin said it best: "Let's not have a double standard,
one standard will do just fine." Apply the same standards to
Israel that we apply to the Palestinians.

October's Last Weekend



 Scott 
 2004-11-01T11:44:00 
Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and
will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad.

The Good:

On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous
Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and
for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live
bands. Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by
brining them into the show. It's something you can always expect from
these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a
show when they're in town.

On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful
Halloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and
bathroom walls, a couple beer spills, unnecessary  *** fights *** (CONFLICT) and the
expected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas. Naturally, I
dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was
having a good time. I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the
guests.

The Bad:

On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland;
effectively ending our chances at a national title this year. In
addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris
Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat. Alas, too little too
late was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been our
starter since  *** replacing *** (PERSONNEL) Rix earlier in the season. Fortunately the agony
of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have
to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday.

On Sunday we saw "Saw" (review coming) and as expected I was less
than satisfied. It was neither better nor worse than last week's "The
Grudge" but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year
and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror
movies. If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's
worth it.

They Refuse to Reason



 Scott 
 2004-11-01T18:06:00 
I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people  *** convene *** (CONTACT),
to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this
morning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong
target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to
tackle huge rises in  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) offences over the past few years,
according to an international firearms legislation expert.

Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as
Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the
law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane  *** massacre *** (CONFLICT),
were aberrations .

The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the
possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the
independent Fraser Institute in Canada. He has given evidence to select
committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted
the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.

His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day
in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour
Government  *** came to power *** (PERSONNEL) in 1997 . In the past two years, there have
been cases of schoolchildren and a baby,  *** killed *** (LIFE) or injured by guns.

"I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," he
said. "Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of
legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police
themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."

Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officers
are inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply with
regulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in a
firearms certificate form, will be  *** smuggling *** (MOVEMENT) a gun into the country or
selling one to an inner city youth."

Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the
year to June . Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham
and Manchester. It doesn't matter to these people that crime has
skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into
effect in Great Britain. Just as long as it's there, they feel safe.

Get Off Their Backs



 Scott 
 2004-11-16T13:47:00 
From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under
investigation for  *** killing *** (LIFE) a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in
Falluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable,
hair-trigger circumstances.

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) as a
scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during
the effort to quell the insurgency in the city.

"I can see why he would do it. He was probably running around being
 *** shot *** (CONFLICT) at for days on end in Falluja. There should be an investigation but
they should look into the circumstances," said Lance Corporal
Christopher Hanson.

"I would have  *** shot *** (LIFE) the insurgent too. Two shots to the head," said
Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. "You can't
trust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothing
wrong." Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this
story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in
question  *** lost *** (LIFE) a fellow soldier who was attending to a  *** dead *** (LIFE) insurgent
that was booby-trapped with explosives.

Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective
suicide  *** bombings *** (CONFLICT), and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn't
on the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines should
handle  *** dead *** (LIFE) and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure
their own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)
either, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian
opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) zones
from their comfortable recliners.

To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States:
You don't have to like our president or those operating this  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), but
get off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation
you will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends in
Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will
support them at every opportunity.
