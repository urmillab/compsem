New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?



 BEGALA 
Well, we'll debate that later on in the show. We'll have a couple of
experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then. Even as the
secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last
month, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men  *** landed *** (MOVEMENT) on
American shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge
now leads. Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the
hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?
Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician. He
lost an  *** election *** (PERSONNEL) to a dead man. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge
is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice
presidency. And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is
yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones
University. Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's
really important, like political consulting.


 NOVAK 
Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional
politician based on that is somebody who is  *** elected *** (PERSONNEL) to public office. Now
in your administration, the Clinton administration, there were these
members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional
politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno,
Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros,
Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mention
former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the great
professional politicians of all time, Bill Daly.


 BEGALA 
And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country. And these
bozos let four armed Cubans land on our shores when they're trying to
make a high terrorist alert. Our president has put homeland security in
the hands of failed Republican hacks.  *** Hire *** (PERSONNEL) professionals, Mr. President.


 NOVAK 
So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
Department and the Pentagon...


 BEGALA 
Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.


 NOVAK 
Just a minute, let me finish my sentence, please. It's OK to  *** put *** (PERSONNEL)
Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department
if they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right?


 BEGALA 
No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.

(CROSSTALK)

 BEGALA 
John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was.


 NOVAK 
Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to
run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was
no. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement today
that he would not be the 10th candidate for the  *** nomination *** (PERSONNEL). Why not?
Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or
Dennis Kucinich. He explained he could better spend the next two years on
homeland security, the economy and judicial  *** nominations *** (PERSONNEL). I guess that
means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President
Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years.


 BEGALA 
God, I hope so. that's all I can say. I love Senator Dodd. He would have
brought a lot to the race. He brings a lot to the Senate and to the
debate. And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights. Well,
the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in
January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February. In all, two
million Americans have  *** lost t *** (PERSONNEL)heir jobs under President Bush so far, not
to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic
team. Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion. It could swell to as
much as $500 billion if we go to  *** war *** (CONFLICT) in Iraq. Mr. Bush apparently is
untroubled by this fiscal collapse. One of his aides tells the current
issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"
Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3
trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund. You
know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he
borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know.


 NOVAK 
Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even
if you won't recognize them. Number one, there is absolutely no
relationship between the deficit and unemployment. They don't go
together. And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia.
There just isn't one.


 BEGALA 
Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts.


 NOVAK 
There never has been one.


 BEGALA 
There has been one for 60 years.

New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary?



 NOVAK 
Welcome back. Orders went out today to  *** deploy *** (MOVEMENT) 17,000 U.S. Army soldiers
in the Persian Gulf region. The army's entire first Calvary division
based at Fort Hood, Texas, would join the quarter million U.S. forces
already in the region. We're talking about possibilities of full scale
 ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) with  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine. He's now
national director of Win Without War, and  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Congressman Bob Dornan,
Republican of California.


 BEGALA 
Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this
 ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have
been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Our
president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're a ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)e,
Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms
program who  *** defected *** (PERSONNEL) for a time. And gave us a whole lot of information
and then went home and his father-in-law  *** killed *** (LIFE) him. Bad move. But while
he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lot
of information. Well, our president told us that information proves that
the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true. But what we just
learned this week from "Newsweek" magazine which got a hold of the
debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995. Why
hasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from
"Newsweek"?


 DORNAN 
I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed. The fact that this
guy was such an idiot to  *** go *** (MOVEMENT) back and let his father-in-law  *** kill *** (LIFE) him shows
he wasn't the most stable of people. But the things that...


 BEGALA 
Good point. But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told
him. Why do we learn from "Newsweek?"Should he level with us?


 DORNAN 
Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT).
Any rational person hates  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). Bush isn't sitting in that White House not
thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clinton
suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that  *** died *** (LIFE), 18 on the 3rd of October
and Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I  *** visited *** (CONTACT) all their families. I
was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, what
 *** trips *** (MOVEMENT) to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the
law of unintended consequences it pertains to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). I am shook over the
aftermath. But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler. He will  *** blow *** (CONFLICT) a
city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do
it.


 NOVAK 
Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) a
nation goes to  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). And so I would like you to take a look at the
CNN/"USA TODAY"/Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to  *** go *** (MOVEMENT) to
Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Take a look at it. Favor 59%,
opposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior
had in  *** getting *** (MOVEMENT) the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) started.
That's pretty good support isn't it?


 ANDREWS 
Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this. I mean, listen, this is the
oldest trick in the book. You can have a general question like this that
could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the
top of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what they
think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask them
about going and not just a  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), Bob, but an  *** invasion *** (CONFLICT) and occupying for up
to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most
distable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel about
getting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you start
telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us
story. They're not coming for ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)d and telling us what the risks are, what
the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us
getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to
this  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT). The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learn
about this occupation, the less they support it.


 DORNAN 
Tom, you know what liberals want. They don't want a smoking gun, they
want a smoking city. The Clinton people all say...


 BEGALA 
That's going to have to be last  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), unfair and unfortunate as that is, I
am sorry, they're telling us we're out of time. Former Congressman, Bob
Dornan from California...


 DORNAN 
You're not going to get a smoking city.

Time for "Fireback," when the viewers fire back at us. Joshua Hosford of

"Paul, I guess we're going after all. Case in point, Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed. It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once.

Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better. In fact, I've already

Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us. We need allies.
And Bush is so far angered every ally we have. Dan Snyder of Baden,

And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins. No?

writes, "How can Bush say he's for democracy? He had to  *** sue *** (JUSTICE) to become our

governments into his supporting his agenda. Where did he learn to govern,

Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders



 BEGALA 
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. President Bush today renewed his call for a
$250,000 cap on pain and suffering  *** damages *** (JUSTICE) from the victims of medical
malpractice. Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day
funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave
young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant
operation last month. Is her family's pain and suffering only worth
$250,000? Here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocate
Ralph Nader and Dr. Donald Palmisano, the president- *** elect *** (PERSONNEL) of the American
Medical Association.

(CROSSTALK)

 NOVAK 
Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by
the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford
the medical malpractice rates. We'll just run a scroll of some of the
states. They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas. This is a real crisis that lawyers have
perpetrated on America, isn't it?


 RALPH NADER, CONSUMER ADVOCATE 
Another one of your leading questions. This is a medical malpractice
crisis. Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day  *** die *** (LIFE) from medical negligence,
hundred of thousands are  *** injured *** (LIFE). And the insurance companies which had
relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its
investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down.
And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like
obstetricians and neurosurgeons. But if you take the entire amount of
premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctors in this country to malpractice
insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each.
That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist.


 NOVAK 
That runs against the fact that so many of them are just  *** leaving *** (PERSONNEL) their
practice because they can't afford it. You know, Ralph, you and I often
agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty
effect of money and politics. Can you say that the lawyers, the  *** trial *** (JUSTICE)
lawyers who  *** appoint *** (TRANSACTION) millions and millions of dollars into Democratic
coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy...


 NADER 
Well, as much as they've  *** poured *** (TRANSACTION) into those coffers, it's much less than
what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the
HMOs and the nursing home chains have  *** poured *** (TRANSACTION) into members of Congress'
coffers. This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity. Are we
going to allow severely  *** injured *** (LIFE) people who have found a lung taken out
that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that
was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant that
was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina. Are we
going to say to these and so many others, you can't  *** have *** (JUSTICE) your full day in
court? The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the
United States at the state court level? I haven't yet met one senator or
representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors
in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent,
unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice
cases. And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives
who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no
one is saying cap those.

(APPLAUSE)

 BEGALA 
Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here.


 DR. DONALD PALMISANO, PRESIDENT-ELECT, AMA 
Thank you. Pleasure to be here.


 BEGALA 
There was a  *** hear *** (JUSTICE) on Capitol Hill today. And, I want to ask you to respond
to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today. He's the father
of a little girl, 13-month-old girl, who he said today  *** died *** (LIFE) because of
medical malpractice. He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2
levels in her blood. Said that the attending physician had slept through
several pages. She died awaiting surgery. Listen to what Mr. McCormick
said and I'll ask you to respond.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 JOHN MCCORMICK, FATHER OF MALPRACTICE VICTIM 
Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are
not frivolous.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

 BEGALA 
Isn't he right? Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win the
Lottery? You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won
the litigation Lottery. Does that look like a Lottery winner to you,
holding a picture of his dead baby?


 PALMISANO 
Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that
they can't get access to care. The American Medical Association works
very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system. That's
why we  *** founded *** (BUSINESS) the National Patient Safety Foundation. The current system
doesn't measure negligence. It measures disability. And what we're
finding now is that the emergency rooms are  *** closing *** (BUSINESS), trauma centers are
 *** closing *** (BUSINESS), pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy
 *** knocked *** (LIFE) unconscious has to be transported to another state. Another
witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no
longer neurosurgeons available in the community. The patient had to be
 *** airavacked *** (MOVEMENT) and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage.


 BEGALA 
Those are important points, I don't doubt.


 PALMISANO 
Yes.


 BEGALA 
But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you,
who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000
for the loss of a child?


 PALMISANO 
Well, what has to be done here is balance. What we need is a system
that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice
and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5,
that's a system that has worked. It brought stability to California and
obstetricians in California will  *** pay *** (JUSTICE) 55, 57, $60,000 in Los Angeles and
in South Florida in Miami, they'll  *** pay *** (JUSTICE) $210,000...(CROSSTALK)


 NADER 
Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium
levels. And in Florida, they've been very weak on it. And in some states,
for example, there are doctors that are -- you know, there are 45  *** payouts *** (JUSTICE)
in ten years and they're not disciplined by the state medical board. I
mean, you've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent
of the  *** payoffs *** (JUSTICE), Paul. In other words a small percentage of doctors that
are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever. They're not performing
properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to
state licensing...

(CROSSTALK)

 PALMISANO 
I want to respond to that. The National Practitioner Data Bank is the
source of the information and it was brought up today. First of all, the
Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used. It lists
multiple  *** claims *** (JUSTICE) against one physician when actually it's really one
 *** claim *** (JUSTICE), different insurers  *** pay *** (JUSTICE) on the same physician and it's counted as
one claim. It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians,
neurosurgeons or emergency medicine. It doesn't list that. Right now in
South Florida, in South Florida, the latest poll shows that every
neurosurgeon has been  *** sued *** (JUSTICE). The average number of  *** suits *** (JUSTICE) against a
neurosurgeon is five in South Florida. Now are these bad doctors? We'll
have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians...


 NOVAK 
We've got to take a break.


 NADER 
Maybe they are bad doctors.

Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders



 NOVAK 
Welcome back. Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports
this week saying out of control trial lawyers are  *** driving *** (BUSINESS) doctors out of
their practices all across the country. President Bush points this way
today, even the most frivolous of  *** lawsuit *** (JUSTICE)s cost money, premiums go up and
either way, the patient pays. We're debating malpractice reform with
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald
Palmisano.


 BEGALA 
Dr. Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break. Let
me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who  *** became *** (PERSONNEL) president because of a
 *** lawsuit *** (JUSTICE) trying to eliminate everybody else's  *** lawsuit *** (JUSTICE)s, but instead focus
on his own experience. He was the governor of my state of Texas, where
there are a whole lot of doctors. It turns out that he didn't do any kind
of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of
Texas. Here's what the "Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "The
Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to
protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who
are  *** thrown out *** (PERSONNEL) of hospitals because they botched operations. It has
forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or
whose mistakes left women sterilized. It has refused in the last five
years to  *** revoke *** (PERSONNEL) the license of a single doctor for committing medical
errors. Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade." That
is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now?


 PALMISANO 
Well, first off...


 BEGALA 
Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me.


 PALMISANO 
Sure. What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one,
have adequate funding. The AMA supports that. If there are any bad
doctors we want them  *** removed *** (PERSONNEL) from the practice of medicine. But it's
also...

(CROSSTALK)

 BEGALA 
... bad doctors?


 PALMISANO 
Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the
facts of the case. Because someone  *** pays *** (TRANSACTION) money in a case, the insurance
company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a
giant award in this case because of this broken liability system. Troy
Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only
with disability. So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody
due process here in America before we criticize.


 NADER 
Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School of
Health said the issue is not to fuel  *** lawsuit *** (JUSTICE)s, it's too many. Less than
10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking about
horrific  *** injuries *** (LIFE) here, even file a claim. Even file a claim. And the
entire  *** pay-out *** (TRANSACTION) to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90
percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog
food. On dog food. It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out. That's a
fraction of physician income. It's a fraction of the health care expense
of 1.4 trillion.


 PALMISANO 
What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here. That's
what the people in Congress have to do. They have to make sure that
whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access
to care.


 NADER 
Doctors are going...


 PALMISANO 
But let me - but let me - wait...


 NADER 
Doctors are  *** leaving *** (PERSONNEL) practice because of insurance premium, right? Is that
right? They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of
a few specialties?


 PALMISANO 
Because of the premiums. But first of all let me...


 NADER 
Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies?


 PALMISANO 
No. Let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about the facts.


 NADER 
That's the fact.


 PALMISANO 
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) percent of the doctors are insured by physician-owned
insurance companies, the medical side. I was just in Oklahoma, they own
this insurance company. They are trying to do their very best. It's a
company not for profit. What happens here is that more money is being
paid out than comes in. And as far as the investment income, A.M. Bests
(ph) show that in the past five years, the investment income has been
stable at around 5 percent. Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments
did not precipitate the current crisis.

(CROSSTALK)

 NADER 
...  *** payoffs *** (TRANSACTION) have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National
Practitioners Databank (ph). Why do you want that to be secret? All of
the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you,
the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients
around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list.


 NOVAK 
Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people
who have been  *** harmed *** (LIFE) by a bad doctor. Let's listen to what he said to the
AMA today.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

 BUSH 
If  *** harmed *** (TRANSACTION) by a doc, they ought to be able to  *** recover *** (TRANSACTION) their economic
costs, economic losses. They should be able to recover non- economic
damages as well. But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages
should be capped at $250,000.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

 NOVAK 
What in the world is wrong with that? Tell me what's wrong with that?


 NADER 
What's wrong? Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant
who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their
lives they're going to get  *** dribbled *** (TRANSACTION) out $250,000 for their entire life
expectancy? Wait a minute. The head of AIG a few years ago was making
$250,000 every week.


 NOVAK 
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though. Not for
you, but for most people it's a lot of money.

(CROSSTALK)

 NADER 
These executives, why don't you tell...


 PALMISANO 
In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California...


 NADER 
Why don't you cap insurance...


 BEGALA 
Mr. Palmisano, go ahead.


 PALMISANO 
Give me a moment, please.


 NADER 
Go ahead, go ahead.


 PALMISANO 
In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the
ones you can't quantify. There are  *** awards *** (TRANSACTION) in 10 million, 20 million, $30
million in California for economic. So all medicals, all rehabilitation,
care services in the home, lost wages...


 NOVAK 
No, no, no. I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time. Doug
Friedman (ph), who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years
ago, says he wants you to run for president again. I know you're saying
it's much too early to run for president. But one simple question, Ralph,
will you consider another run for president?


 NADER 
Much too early to consider. I am concerned about Donald Zook (ph), who's
head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West,
saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame
the tort injury system. He said that your problem of jacking up these
insurance rates is self-inflicted. Here's an insurance company executive
who is saying that.


 PALMISANO 
Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting. What we need to do is
look at all of the people who don't have doctors...


 NADER 
Hey, let's get some agreement. Should we get some agreement?


 PALMISANO 
What...


 NADER 
Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors?


 PALMISANO 
We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits.


 NADER 
Fine. Fine.


 PALMISANO 
Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no  *** payment *** (TRANSACTION). What kind
of peer review is that?


 NADER 
Wait. Wait. Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors? You're in AMA.


 PALMISANO 
We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors. But...(CROSSTALK)


 NADER 
Do you want to control insurance rates?


 PALMISANO 
We want the free market to dictate what is done.


 BEGALA 
The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials
here on CNN or we're all out of...


 PALMISANO 
Thanks. Privilege to be here.

just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals
that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the
pledge of allegiance in public classrooms. schools in nine
western states would have been prohibited from having
students say the pledge starting monday. the stay was
granted to give the school districts involved in the
initial cases 90 days to  *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) to the u.s. supreme court

but the phrase under god which was ad ded to the pledge in

of the united states upheld the toughest three strikes law
in the country yesterday. that's california's. they
rejected challenges to the law of  *** sentences *** (JUSTICE) of 25 years to

a day when their miracle finally came true.


she looks very, very healthy. she's grown a lot. and i'm just so
absolutely thrilled. i couldn't believe it. in fact, i had to take a
double take and pull her back away from me and say, "is it really

reporter: can you describe elizabeth's demeanor? you said she looked
good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal. is
she still scared? she excited? happy?


i don't know. i mean, it was just -- i'm sure she was just thrilled to
be back. i just -- such happiness and such love. and i just held her,

i just brought her little brother william in. and as william and she

thank you very much. if you are going to  *** fight *** (CONFLICT) on the ground, you have

attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area.

on we go in the meantime. again, today, there were
disturbing hints, and we underscore hints here, that
coalition forces may soon face an  *** attack *** (CONFLICT) using chemical
weapons. yesterday the story centered on intelligence
regarding enemy intentions. today the evidence is somewhat
more tangible. reporting for us, cnn's david ensor.


reporter: the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be
planning to  *** use *** (CONFLICT) chemical weapons. gas masks turning up in
abandoned trenches. in nasiriyah in a building marked as a
hospital u.s. marines found weapons, atropine antidote
kits, and that was not all.


they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well
as a number of iraqi military uniforms.


reporter: the findings are heightening concerns among
coalition forces  *** approaching *** (MOVEMENT) baghdad since, as the iraqis
should know, u.s. and british forces do not use chemical
weapons. u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a
red line may have been drawn around the capital with
republican guard units ordered to  *** use *** (CONFLICT) chemical weapons once
u.s. and allied troops cross it. there is also
intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard
units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical
agents.


there has been intelligence scraps, who knows how accurate
they are, chatter in the system, that suggests that the
closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the
greater the likelihood and that some command and control
arrangements have been put in place.


reporter: in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz
repeated his government's stand -- it does not have any
kind of weapons of mass destruction.


translator: when they started to talk about the weapons of
mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was
fabrication and lines.


reporter: experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely
try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without
 *** using *** (CONFLICT) the weapons his government insists it does not have,
hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and
britain to back down.


in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be
counterproductive to saddam, because it would only
galvanize international

for some americans who find themselves spending hours on
end watching television coverage of the  *** war *** (CONFLICT), it can be hard
to break away. that is especially true if you have a loved
one in the  *** war *** (CONFLICT) zone. but as our candy crowley reminds us,
life does and must go on.


reporter: spring-time and a game of catch on the washington
mall. a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific
ocean. that other place, the one on tv all the time, might
as well be on another planet. and that may be the point.


we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this
is a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage,
everything, and kind of relax


reporter: time to redefine normal again, which on the
homefront now seems to mean life as you live it only
weirder.


i'm amazed at how unaffected i am by things, how i'm still
coming to work and doing the same things and going for a
walk in the morning. and it just seems so strange to me
that it's almost a parallel universe.


more than 70 percent of americans say they are sad about
the  *** war *** (CONFLICT). the barber at hinsville georgia larries that.


they seem more depressed. a lot of them afraid they're
going to lose their jobs, you know, the economy is down and
all kind of stuff.


life on the homefront seems the same at farmer's market in
los angeles, but it's more angst ridden.


i don't think it's affecting our business as much as i was
worried that it would, but you never know it's going to
happen. if there's any kind of  *** terrorism *** (CONFLICT) that happens here,
i think that would definitely put a damper on everything.


nationwide, people shopped less in the first week of the
 *** war *** (CONFLICT). sales fell 2 percent from the previous week. air
travel has fallen 10 mers since the  *** war *** (CONFLICT) began and some
hotel chains say cancellations are up. 60 percent of the
people say they're watching the  *** war *** (CONFLICT).


my boyfriend has been watching the tv like every single
day, every time it comes on, he's watching it.


maybe fewer people are shoning because they're watching tv.
maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism
or they worry about what the  *** war *** (CONFLICT) will do to the economy or
maybe it's everything.


there's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn,
it's an overall feeling, a psychological feeling that
everything is frozen, everything is on hold. consumers
aren't spending, people aren't buying stock, everything is

we're getting late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not
be be  *** kicked out *** (MOVEMENT) of iraq after all. originally the central
command said the veteran fox news correspond was being
expelled because he compromised the location of the unit
he's been embedded with. now a spokesman from the central
command is saying and i'm quoting "frankly, we have bigger
and more important things to do." during a live broadcast
geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the
unit in relation to baghdad. says he's not aware he's being
expelled but says if so, it is because some bitter former
colleagues of his at msnbc blew the whistle on him.


it sounds to me like some rats at my  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) network, nbc,
are spreading some lies about me. you know, they can't
compete fair and square on the battlefield so they're
trying to stab me in the back. it is not first time.

kicked out of iraq because "he gave away the big picture
stuff." all of this now under review, whether or not
geraldo stays or goes. we'll continue to monitor that front

yesterday. he said the coalition's first  *** war *** (CONFLICT) plan had
failed because of iraqi resistance. today he appeared on on
nbc's "today" show and said he was sorry.


i want to apologize to the american people for clearly
making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an
interview to iraqi television. now, i said in that
interview essentially what we all know about the war, there
have been delays in implementing policy, there has been
surprises. but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi
television, i created a firestorm in the united states. and
for that i am truly sorry.

which also  *** fired *** (PERSONNEL) him as tv reports were given exclusively

 *** bombardment *** (CONFLICT) of baghdad continues tonight and over the past
20 minutes, explosions rocking baghdad, central baghdad
southern baghdad, the outskirts of baghdad, and
importantly, as the coalition forces, principally u.s. army
forces,  *** move *** (MOVEMENT) against saddam hussein international airport
-- which is about ten miles outside the center of baghdad
-- those explosions are intensifies. if we may again going
to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi
television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m. in
baghdad, live pictures again. that it is very difficult to
discern whether or not that is, in point of fact, the
missiles that we have become accustomed to  *** striking *** (CONFLICT) baghdad
and its environs, or whether it is the large 2,000 pound
jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the
coalition in baghdad, or whether these flashes now
represent artillery barrages as  *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) continues to take
control of the -- to take control of saddam international
airport. again, correspondents, our correspondents with the
-- embedded with these forces, with them in the field,
saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline
of baghdad. over the course of the past two weeks, since
this war began, something like 23,000 coalition sorties
have been flown, and over the course of the past 24 hours,
1,900 sorties flown. and we are told that, of those, 850
were  *** strike *** (CONFLICT) sorties, motor vehicle most of those directed
against the republican guard. as you know, the republican
guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam
hussein's regime, in principal. two of those divisions
absolutely devastated,  *** destroyed *** (CONFLICT). the so-called medina
division, and the baghdad division. the baghdad division,
of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the
republican guard division designated to defend principally
baghdad. four other divisions we are told have also been
 *** hit *** (CONFLICT) very, very very hard and are principally trying to
reinforce units va also been  *** hit *** (CONFLICT) very hard. so we are
seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are
calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one
person from the center of baghdad. and that raises
questions, questions that have been in front of us since
that first  *** strike *** (CONFLICT) on march 19th against the location that
the cia military intelligence thought was a place where
saddam hussein, perhaps his sons, were. that preemptive
strike they put, i think somewhat elegantly, trying to
strike at the head of the snake. new  *** explosions *** (CONFLICT) rocking
parts of baghdad tonight. we will continue to monitor that.
we, of course, will bring the word to you just as soon as
the army and coalition forces do  *** take *** (TRANSACTION) control of saddam
hussein international airport, just on the outskirts of
baghdad. in southern iraq today, british forces also  *** moving *** (MOVEMENT)

Hi.


 Sara 
Hey.


 Suzanne 
So who do you think should run?


 Sara 
uh -- I don't know. I was going to say, that's quite the topic.  um -- I
haven't thought about it much.  I know my husband said he thinks -- that
uh -- Colin Powell should -- but I don't think he will.


 Suzanne 
I I don't he think will either, because he turned it down in two
thousand and four.


 Sara 
Right, and


 Suzanne 
Sorry, two thousand and -- two thousand.


 Sara 
Two thousand, yeah, the one before that.


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
Yeah.  uh -- I'm not very fond of Hillary Clinton, so I -- I don't think
I'd go for her, but -- but uh what do you think?


 Suzanne 
um -- I am reluctant to see another Bush brother on the ticket for the
Republicans


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
but I think that putting Jeb Bush would make h- -- the Republican ticket
easier to defeat.


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
um -- I really don't think that Hillary Clinton -- would be -- a good choice
for the Democrats.


 Sara 
Yeah.


 Suzanne 
um I don't think Barak Obama would be a very good choice for the
Democrats.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
Just because he's -- he's really young, and he's going to be starting
off his career.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
um I would almost like to see John Edwards on the ticket again.


 Sara 
Uh-huh. Yeah.  uh Yeah. Did they ever do that one? That's n- the-
that's happened before, hasn't it, where someone who -- who was
defeated ran again?


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
They don't do it very often, probably just because they figure if he
lost once, he'll


 Suzanne 
Well I I think he's a really good candidate, and four more years could
really help him develop his um -- could help him develop -- hi- his
voting record especially.


 Sara 
Right.


 Suzanne 
And I think that would help the Democratic ticket a lot.


 Sara 
Right, because that's something he got -- kind of -- uh -- got brought up a
lot.


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
Hm. Well, they -- let's see.


 Suzanne 
I mean, I'd like to s- -- I'd like to see the Greens  *** run *** (PERSONNEL) David Cobb
again.


 Sara 
Uh-huh.  uh See, hav- I haven't paid much attention to them, I -- I
kind of looked at the -- the other listed candidates -- but I figure -- they
d- -- they d- none of them had enough support to get close, so


 Suzanne 
Yeah.


 Sara 
um -- trying to think who else -- Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't think --
well he's not qualified anyway, but


 Suzanne 
Well, they might change something, you know, between now and then.


 Sara 
I've heard people say that would take a -- I I don't think they will.
uh That takes a Constitutional amendment. That's pretty hard to -- to
get through.


 Suzanne 
Well, I mean, you live in California. How is he doing -- in your state?


 Sara 
Oh, I think he's done all right, um -- I I -- He's a he's a moderate
Republican, you know, he's not


 Suzanne 
Right.


 Sara 
he's not uh -- hard core Republican, so he works pretty well with -- since
this is this is mostly a Democratic State.  He does pretty well.


 Suzanne 
um -- They've been talking about getting the Canadian-born governor of
I think Minnesota


 Sara 
Mhm.


 Suzanne 
to run as well. um


 Sara 
Hm.


 Suzanne 
It'd be the first woman running.


 Sara 
Right.  Have they never had a woman run before? I know they've


 Suzanne 
Well, Geraldine Ferraro -- well the first woman for a major party.
Geraldine Ferraro ran

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Right.

But they've never had a woman as a major candidate


 Sara 
Uh-huh.


 Suzanne 
for President.


 Sara 
Right.  Yeah. It's got to happen at some point.


 Suzanne 
Right. Because Elizabeth Dole didn't make it too well.


 Sara 
Right.  Yeah, she was she was going to be the -- was she going to be the
Vice President


 Suzanne 
I think she was g- actually going for President herself.

I'd like to see her come back. um I think she's fantastic.

with a -- fresh, with a different perspective, who wasn't already just

 A 
Right.  Yeah.


 B 
You know, because I think by the time they get to office, it really
doesn't really matter who is, you know,


 A 
Yeah, they're still under the gun of the same big


 B 
who's in there. They're so


 A 
corporate giants or whatever.


 B 
Well, that's right, that's right. So um


 A 
Mhm.


 B 
Yeah, so I don't know I w- I was quite excited to have somebody that
was coming from a really different perspective. But that got shot out

 A 
Mhm hm.


 B 
I I like Hillary. I I


 A 
Yeah.  Yeah.  I like her, she's my Senator, of course.


 B 
Well, of course. That's right.

 B 
a a woman, potentially, as President, I mean, I think she's the
strongest


 A 
Do some reading


 B 
candidate we've had in a long time.


 A 
Do s- -- Do some reading on the governors,  of New Mexico, or is it
Arizona, and particularly Kansas, and the governor of North Carolina.


 B 
Oh, really?


 A 
Do some reading on those three people, those are some people you
should be really looking uh looking at, if y- if uh


 B 
You're obviously a qu- -- a pretty politically savvy kind of guy,
aren't you?


 A 
Well, I was the one, who just happened to  *** go *** (MOVEMENT) home back in like
nineteen eighty or something and saw Bill Clinton


 B 
Oh, yeah?


 A 
on on television. He -- we ha- -- I came from a small town in
Tennessee called Paris, and there's two stations we can pick up, one


 B 
Okay.


 A 
from Jackson, a little town, and the other was from Nashville, a big
town. So we got most of our ~TV from Jackson,  so I was flipping
through the channels, and I saw this little guy, uh the governor of
Arkansas giving a speech.


 B 
Yep.


 A 
I said, that guy could  *** be *** (PERSONNEL) President.


 B 
Is that right?


 A 
I only heard about -- two minutes of him speaking.  You know, he was
articulate, he was charming, he was young. And I said, that guy could
be president.


 B 
Yep.  Yep.


 A 
And um so then when I heard he was running,  those four years later --
uh, eight years later, whatever it was. Because it was a long time
later.


 B 
Sure.


 A 
I saw him, and I was telling all my friends, oh, vote for vote for
this guy, Bill Clinton, vote for him. They were saying, oh no, no,
that old country -- dump. He don't know nothing. I said, he's a Rhodes
scholar, he's smart.  He's and he's funny and he's good. Oh no, no,
he's too young, and he came from that little, little podunk -- g- uh
state he never did anything. I said, he's going to be President. I was
telling all my friends. I said, you know, and I was before -- they
said, well, I thought you supported George Bush, and I said, well I
did support George Bush, but he doesn't know what he's doing and he
needs to  *** go *** (PERSONNEL).  And uh so I says vote for him, vote for him, vote for
him, you know. And they voted for Jerry Brown and all these crazy
people.


 B 
Yeah, that's right.  Oh, is that right?


 A 
And I says, you're just wasting your vote, why are you doing that? He
needs your help.  So I went and volunteered for him and everything,
and -- and I  *** met *** (CONTACT) Hillary, and and Tipper and Al, and and I almost got to
meet him.


 B 
Oh, is that right?  Really?


 A 
Uh-huh. I worked at the Democrats Convention and everything. Uh-huh,
yeah.


 B 
Very cool, very cool.


 A 
And uh it was great, I had a good time, and they


 B 
What great experience.


 A 
Yeah, and they fed us, and had a party for us, all that kind of stuff,
you know. So it was fun. But it worked out. But I think we they better
go back to a governor from like uh


 B 
Well, sure.


 A 
uh North Carolina, or like the one from Kansas. She's very tall, she
reminds you of uh Christie Whitman, the governor of New Jersey,
remember her?


 B 
Yep.  Okay?


 A 
She's tall, kind of -- mm bush -- butch.  Ac- kind of. She's uh you
know, like she played basketball or something like that. Real smart,
quiet-spoked but stern, you know.


 B 
Yeah, not not real feminine, yeah.  Eh sure.


 A 
And so I -- she she can give that demeanor that people like in
leaders,  of being the big


 B 
Well, people want to feel secure, right? And who's in that position?
They want to feel that they're trustworthy and honorable, and I think,
you know


 A 
yeah.  Yeah, but


 B 
Clinton did so many fantastic things during his term in office, but he
shot himself on the foot with all of his personal garbage, you know,
and I think that overshadowed how brilliant he was as President.


 A 
Yeah.  It does.

DAVAO, Philippines, March 4 (AFP)

At least 19 people were  *** killed *** (LIFE) and 114 people were wounded in
Tuesday's southern Philippines airport  ***  *** blast *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), officials said, but
reports said the  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) toll could climb to 30.

Radio station DXDC placed the  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) toll at 30, without giving a
source for the figure, which officials could not immediately confirm.

The Davao Medical Center, a regional government hospital, recorded 19
 ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE)s with 50  *** wounded *** (LIFE). Medical evacuation workers however said the
injured list was around 114, spread out at various hospitals.

A powerful bomb tore through a waiting shed at the Davao City
international airport at about 5.15 pm (0915 GMT) while another
explosion hit a bus terminal at the city. There were no reports of
 *** injuries *** (LIFE) in the second  *** blast *** (CONFLICT).

"It's a very powerful bomb. The waiting shed literally exploded,"
said Vice Mayor Luis Bongoyan, speaking to local radio station

Television footage showed medical teams  *** carting *** (MOVEMENT) away dozens of
wounded victims with fully armed troops on guard.

Many of the victims were shown with hastily applied bandages, and
teams of nurses and doctors were seen in packed emergency rooms
attending to the wounded.

Sotheby's, Christie's pay 40 million dollars over antitrust suits


NEW YORK, March 11 (AFP)

The world's most powerful fine art auction houses, Sotheby's and
Christie's, have agreed to  *** pay *** (TRANSACTION) 40 million dollars to settle an
international price-fixing scam, Sotheby's said.

The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of  *** suits *** (JUSTICE)
by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the
United States, it said in a statement.

"Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and
Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars," said Sotheby's, which
operates in 34 countries.

The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both
auction houses to be dropped.

Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to  *** pursue *** (JUSTICE) further
cases in foreign courts.

The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States
between January 1, 1993 and February 7, 2000, and sellers between
September 1, 1995 and February 7, 2000.

Similar claims over US-based auctions were  *** settled *** (TRANSACTION) in an agreement
struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars.

In December 2001, a Manhattan jury  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) Sotheby's main
shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a
price-fixing agreement with Christie's.

Four months later, the billionaire was  *** sentenced *** (JUSTICE) to one year in
prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing, which
prosecutors said had  *** cost *** (TRANSACTION) clients of both firms 400 million dollars.

Christie's was not  *** prosecuted *** (JUSTICE) in the United States after its
management agreed to testify against Sotheby's and provide documents
needed to prove fraudulent intent.

Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control more than 90 percent of
the fine art and antiques market.

Sotheby's said it would record the 20-million-dollar settlement as a
special charge for 2002. It would be funded in two payments of 10
million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval.

Barry Diller resigns as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment
ATTENTION - ADDS details, background ///


NEW YORK, March 19 (AFP)

Media tycoon Barry Diller on Wednesday  *** quit *** (PERSONNEL) as chief of Vivendi
Universal Entertainment, the entertainment unit of French giant
Vivendi Universal whose future appears up for grabs.

In a statement, Diller -- who  *** took on *** (PERSONNEL) the "provisional" role at the
top of Vivendi's US entertainment operations in December -- said his
USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of
Vivendi Universal Entertainment.

"My executive role was never intended to be permanent," said Diller.
"Now that Vivendi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing
options for its entertainment assets, it is appropriate to step aside
from any direct management responsibility."

As part of the 11-billion-dollar  *** sale *** (TRANSACTION) of USA Interactive's film and
television operations to the French media company in December 2001,
USA Interactive received 2.5 billion dollars in preferred shares in
Vivendi Universal Entertainment.

Diller, 60, personally received a 1.5 percent stake in the business
and had been touted as a likely candidate to run Vivendi Universal's
entertainment unit in the United States if the troubled French media
giant were broken up.

In Paris, the French media group said parent company chairman
Jean-Rene Fourtou will  *** replace *** (PERSONNEL) Diller as chairman and chief executive
of US unit.

Vivendi, in a statement, said that Diller had, "in full agreement
with Vivendi Universal," announced that he was " *** ending *** (PERSONNEL) his temporary
assignment as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment."

Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media group after AOL
Time Warner of the United States, has been digging out from under a
mountain of debt since the  *** removal *** (PERSONNEL) of expansionist boss Jean-Marie
Messier last July, largely through asset sales.

Vivendi Universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23.3
billion euros (25.6 billion dollars) for 2002.

Faced with debt of 35 billion euros (37 billion dollars) in June last
year -- including 19 billion from the media and telecoms division
alone -- the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its
debt by 16 billion euros by end-2004.

Speculation has been rife that troubled Vivendi has been weighing a
spinoff or  *** sale *** (TRANSACTION) of its US film, television and theme park operations
as part of its restructuring.

Press speculation had already suggested that Vivendi might decide to
keep its Universal Music division, while either divesting or inviting
third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining Entertainment
assets.

Earlier this month, sources told Agence France Presse financial news
unit AFX that Viacom is studying a bid for Vivendi's US entertainment
assets placing it as a serious rival squarely in the running against
oil billionaire Marvin Davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the
operations.

While other media companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Liberty Media
Corp, News Corp and General Electric Co's NBC have been mentioned as
potential bidders for the Vivendi operations, Viacom is one of the
few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a
bid.

At least 200,000 in US, Canadian anti- *** war *** (CONFLICT)  *** demonstrations *** (CONFLICT) = (PICTURES)
= ATTENTION - UPDATES, ADDS details ///


NEW YORK, March 23 (AFP)

Some 70 people were  *** arrested *** (JUSTICE) Saturday as demonstrators  *** clashed *** (CONFLICT) with
police at the end of a major peace rally here, as at least 200,000
anti- *** war *** (CONFLICT) protesters took to the streets across the United States and
Canada.

For the most part the  *** marches *** (CONFLICT) went off peacefully, but in New York a
small group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go home
at the end of their rally, police sources said.

Several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after the
ensuing  *** clashes *** (CONFLICT) -- a result, police said, of the demonstrators using
self-defence devices.

Organisers claimed that some 250,000 people attended the rally,
creating a human column some three kilometres (1.8 miles) long.
Police put the attandance at around 125,000.

The city assigned 2,000 police officers to the rally, including
undercover officers who carried beeper-sized radiation detectors and
other counter-terrorism equipment.

Though opinion polls have shown public support for the  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) rising in
the United States, opposition to military intervention in Iraq has
given rise to an impassioned campaign.

Among the sea of banners making its way up Broadway were many signs
poking fun at President George W. Bush. "Somewhere in Texas, a
village is missing an idiot," said one sign. "Iraq  *** war *** (CONFLICT): An unelected
extremist vs. an unelected extremist," and "Take the toys away from
junior."

One woman  *** marched *** (CONFLICT) topless with the words "shock and awe" daubed
across her back in red ink, a reference to the bombing campaign
unleashed Friday on Baghdad.

Liana Owen  *** drove *** (MOVEMENT) 10 hours from Pennsylvania to attend the rally in
Manhattan with her parents. "It's important that people all over the
world know that we don't believe in the  *** war *** (CONFLICT)," she said.

Several thousand demonstrators also  *** gathered *** (CONFLICT) outside the White House
in Washington, accompanied by a major security presence.

"They can say they're 'smart bombs,' but smart bombs aren't able to
distinguish between military and human targets," Abigail Fletcher, a
marcher from Florida, said outside the president's residence.

Some of the slogans sought to rebut  *** war *** (CONFLICT) supporters' arguments that
the protests are unpatriotic. "We support our troops --  *** bring *** (MOVEMENT) them
home!" read one.

A former serviceman, Michael Schmidt of Peoria, Illinois, said: "It's
up to me to help the US -- from here."

Others were more blunt, with one banner reading "Shocked, Awed -- and
Disgusted."

One group, Lesbians Against Boys Invading Anything, carried signs
saying "Pre-emptive  *** war *** (CONFLICT) is terrorism," "This isn't the USA I love,"
and "Where Will the Bombs  *** Fall *** (CONFLICT) Next?"

Up to 20,000 protesters thronged the plazas and streets of San
Francisco, where more than 1,600 people were arrested in the past two
days in a civil disobedience  *** campaign *** (CONFLICT).

Between 2,500 and 3,000 people  *** picketed *** (CONFLICT) the CNN studios in Los
Angeles while others at the Atlanta headquarters  *** protested *** (CONFLICT) the cable
network's coverage of the  *** war *** (CONFLICT) for being biased to *** war *** (CONFLICT)d the United
States.

"They make this look like a John Wayne movie," said protester Elvis
Woods. "You watch CNN and all you get are  *** explosions *** (CONFLICT) and video of
tanks and guns. Nobody questions whether this is right or not."

Counter- *** demonstrations *** (CONFLICT) in support of the US-led invasion of Iraq took
place in some cities, with some 2,500 people  *** turning out *** (CONFLICT) in Chicago.
Flying the US flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance, they
outnumbered their anti- *** war *** (CONFLICT) counterparts by three to one.

Passions ran deep on both sides, but a line of police in riot gear
kept them apart. Carrying signs that said, "It's the oil, stupid,"
and "Real men don't  *** bomb *** (CONFLICT) children," the anti- *** war *** (CONFLICT) protesters waved
blue Earth flags.

"I agree Saddam is crazy and needs to go, but it's not our place to
do it," said Ian Wisniewski, 14, who had a fake bullet hole painted
on his forehead. "It's crazy that we're bombing Iraq. It sickens me."

A few yards away, Claire Tortorello, 54, pointed and yelled at the
protesters across the plaza. Holding a framed picture of her son,
serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq, she said she
didn't know whether he was  *** dead *** (LIFE) or alive.

"I'm here to support him and others who are  *** fighting *** (CONFLICT) for their
country. They wouldn't be here if it weren't for the freedoms that
others  *** fought *** (CONFLICT) for," she said.

Anti- *** war *** (CONFLICT)  *** protests *** (CONFLICT) took place around the world Saturday after the
start of the  *** bombing *** (CONFLICT) of Baghdad. Hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators took to the streets in Britain, Spain and Italy, whose
governments approved of the  *** war *** (CONFLICT).

In Montreal, "Stop the War," a coalition of more than 190 groups,
said as many as 200,000 people  *** turned out *** (CONFLICT), though police refused to
give a figure.

Protesters also  *** gathered *** (CONFLICT) in their thousands in Halifax, Calgary,
Edmonton and Vancouver.

Organizers of the civil disobedience campaigns promised to block
intersections and bridges, shackle themselves to lampposts and create
human cordons to snarl traffic, as long as the  *** war *** (CONFLICT) continues.

Some 3,000 people have been  *** arrested *** (JUSTICE) since the disobedience  *** campaigns *** (CONFLICT)
began last week.

Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on  *** death *** (LIFE) row


JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP)

Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an
Indian on  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) row after five of them  *** appealed *** (JUSTICE) to the Supreme Court
for a second review, prosecutors said Thursday.

"If we  *** execute *** (JUSTICE) them now we can't bring them to life again should
their  *** appeals *** (JUSTICE) for a review be granted," said Antasari Azhar,
spokesman for the attorney general's office.

The Supreme Court rejected earlier  *** appeals *** (JUSTICE) for a case review from
five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one  *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) for
a review.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and
asked for a speedy  *** execution *** (JUSTICE). Five of them are Indonesians  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE)
of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad
Chaubey.

"We are talking about someone's life or  ***  *** death *** (LIFE) *** (LIFE) so we have to be very
careful," Azhar said.

A convict can file a case review or  *** appeal *** (JUSTICE) for presidential clemency
only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower
court.

Apart from those  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) of murder, 16 people are on  *** death *** (LIFE) row for
drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch
citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin.

Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe  *** sentences *** (JUSTICE),
including  *** death *** (LIFE), for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an
increasingly serious problem in the country.

Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of
 *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the
 *** death *** (LIFE) penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other
punishments.

Amnesty opposes the  *** death *** (LIFE) penalty for any crime.

Use of the  *** death *** (LIFE) penalty is rare in Indonesia, where the last
execution was carried out in May 2001 of two men  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) of a
murder in 1989. It was the first execution for five years.

A police  *** firing *** (CONFLICT) squad enforces the penalty.

2,500 Japanese students in Osaka protest against Iraq war


TOKYO, March 30 (AFP)

Some 2,500 mainly university students formed a human chain in
Japanese characters spelling out "No War" in Osaka on Sunday to
 *** protest *** (CONFLICT) against the ongoing US-led military  *** campaign *** (CONFLICT) in Iraq.

"We cannot forgive this war," Miyako Fuji, 20, one of the rally's
organisers told Jiji news agency. "I want to join together the
feelings of each of us as individuals who oppose the war."

Protesters, who exceeded the 2,000 expected to show up at the park at
Osaka Castle in the city's downtown neighbourhood, carried placards
that read "Stop war" and "Love and Peace" while forming the human
chain after 3:00 pm (0600 GMT), Jiji said.

The protest follows a string of  *** others *** (CONFLICT) involving tens of thousands of
peace activists across Japan since January.

According to a poll by Kyodo news agency released Saturday, 78 of 100
people surveyed opposed the military action in Iraq.

A separate poll of 1,846 adults by the leading Yomiuri newspaper
published Tuesday showed 64 percent felt Japan had "no choice" but to
back the United States, with only 12 percent saying Japan had "every
reason" to back the war.

government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend.

"Senior government officials, speaking in the corridors of power in
Moscow, have no illusions about any long-term perspectives for the
(Russian-German-French) axis," the respected Izvestia daily reported.

"Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates will
resume normal relations," the senior Moscow official, who was
reported to be close to Putin, told the paper.

"The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an
argument with the United States."

The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war in
Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protect
his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face
of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin
officials.

Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve
friendly relations with the United States than the pro-European,
anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign
and defense ministries.

Russia's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top
Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight
billion dollars in Soviet-era debt that Baghdad owes it, as a gesture
of good will.

Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furious
front-page headline: "The United States is demanding that Russia,
France and Germany  *** pay *** (TRANSACTION) for the Iraqi war."

And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed: "We should have
expected this!.. This is only the start of a massive US campaign (to
decide Iraq's future finances)."

Yet Putin has been far more reserved. He and his loyal finance
minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver
some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia-US relations.

"On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate," Putin
said. "Russia has no objections to such a proposal."

Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with
Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on
Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a
post-war revival of Iraq.

The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders
before the US-British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential
for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration
on Iraq.

And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so
closely associated with the anti-Washington stance of Schroeder and
Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush.

Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Bush's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq, to  *** attend *** (MOVEMENT) the pow-wow in
Saint Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, although diplomats said Blair
turned the offer down.

It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washington
will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war
stance.

A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the United
States Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq.

"We do not think that America won," said Dmitry Rogozin, the head of
the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told
Rossia television.

"Where are those chemical weapons?" he demanded.

And Putin's media aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Kommersant Russia
would not forgive the Iraqi debt.

"(Washington) should not be so generous at other people's expense,"
he said.

Three hacked to death in India over witchcraft allegations


GUWAHATI, India, April 17 (AFP)

At least three members of a family in Indias northeastern state of
Tripura were  *** hacked *** (CONFLICT) to death by a tribal mob for allegedly practicing
witchcraft, police said Thursday.

A spokesman said a group of 25 to 30 armed men Wednesday  *** attacked *** (CONFLICT) a
house belonging to a village quack doctor in Tultuli, 60 kilometers
(38 miles) south of Tripuras state capital Agartala.

"The mob dragged out three members of a family and (killed) them with
machetes and spears before  *** fleeing *** (MOVEMENT) the area," the spokesman said by
 *** telephone *** (CONTACT) from Agartala.

The dead included the quack doctor, 55-year-old Nityalila Naotia, his
teenaged son and another member of the family, whom he did not
identify.

"It was believed Naotia was a practicing sorcerer and through his
black magic he had cast evil spells on villagers, prompting a group
within the village to  *** eliminate *** (LIFE) them," the spokesman said.

Police have  *** arrested *** (JUSTICE) four people in connection with the  *** killings *** (LIFE).

Superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integral to the
tribal custom in parts of Tripura and other northeast Indian states.

Many tribes practice faiths believed to be a mix of black magic and
superstition.

Russia misplayed Iraq hand, but damage to US relations not fatal:
analysts by Dmitry Zaks


MOSCOW, April 17 (AFP)

Silence is golden -- especially when your hand is weak -- top Moscow
policy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from Russia's
vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US-led  *** campaign *** (CONFLICT) in
Iraq.

Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin-run  *** forum *** (CONTACT) that countries
like China and India that said little about the conflict before its
March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits.

Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be
scrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship with
US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his
intelligence and defense aides.

One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UN
Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the
war -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the United
States and North Korea because other regional powers' confidence in
Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy.

"We are losing our positions in Asia because ... this failure of a
strategic triangle that (Foreign Minister Igor) Ivanov invented with
Germany and France," fumed Andrei Piontkovsky of Moscow's Center of
Strategic Studies.

 *** Negotiations *** (CONTACT) between Washington and Pyongyang on their nuclear
dispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen here
as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by
organizing such a meeting.

Meanwhile the European "peace camp" troika finds itself in tricky
diplomatic isolation from Washington.

French President Jacques Chirac received only a reserved response
when he tried to mend fences by placing a telephone  *** call *** (CONTACT) Tuesday to
Bush.

Meanwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has not spoken to Bush
since several weeks before the start of the war.

But not everyone here agreed that Moscow's diplomatic relations with
Washington had suffered as badly.

Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin to
quickly reassess the quality of his advisers.

"Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to Cold
 *** War *** (CONFLICT) stereotypes," said former deputy foreign minister Anatoly
Adamishin.

"We were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with France and Germany
-- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 years
and someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossible
to avert this war."

"Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the United
States do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible."

US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington's anger with
European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- and
to a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow.

Putin last spoke to Bush on April 5 at the US president's own
initiative. They are scheduled to  *** meet *** (CONTACT) next in the Russian leader's
native city of Saint Petersburg in late May.

"We lost nothing and won nothing -- this was not our war," said
liberal lawmaker Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces.

"We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in
Iraq cheaply and we did not. We should continue sticking to our
principles."

Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia's help
"to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate."

Most analysts linked Russia's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears
that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppled
regime of Saddam Hussein.

The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world
markets and hurt Russia's budget revenues -- which are heavily
reliant on revenues from its own energy exports.

But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin's own standing
among voters will be hurt by Russia's apparent diplomacy failures.

Putin will face re-election in March 2004 and analysts noted that the
war -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by the
Kremlin into a matter of national security.

"I do not think that this will affect the  *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) unless Russia's
failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- and
has not been yet," said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center  *** funded *** (TRANSACTION)
by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.

( *** bombings *** (CONFLICT),  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) farmers in their fields, bulldozing crops,

I would suggest everyone read the body of the entire item they're

WHICH ID she's using. Also, I have seen in the past, others reselling
items usuing her COA's. Be careful.

I am miffed the UACC would not check into people before allowing them
to be members if in fact she is a member. But I will reserve
judgement till they respond.

This makes one really skeptical. But if you see a UACC member on
Ebay, don't automatically assume they are legit. Contact the UACC
before buying and ask if they are a member. If you suspect something
is fake, do not take it for granted it's legit because a UACC number
is attached to it. In cases where the member claims and IS a UACC

fakes by that person, do NOT hesitate to let the UACC and Ebay know.

 Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis 


"Minutes after a massive earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean on Sunday,
international ocean monitors knew that a tsunami would likely follow. But
they didn't know whom to tell.

"We put out a bulletin within 20 minutes, technically as fast as we could
do it," says Jeff LaDouce of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. LaDouce says  *** e-mails *** (CONTACT) were dispatched to Indonesian

It looks more like the Indonesian officials weren't sitting at their

Well, I have yet to hear that scientists from any other country even made

Perhaps the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a

article notes, the American scientists did not know who to contact. That's
hardly their problem, let alone their fault.

On the other hand, if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving
people from tsunamis, you would think you might have figured out
beforehand who you might  *** call *** (CONTACT) if you did get some advanced warning of
such an event. Also, the Indonesian government probably had no idea that
NOAA could give them advanced warning of tsunamis so how could they know

So it cuts both ways, the Indonesian government should have done some

October's Last Weekend



 Scott 
 2004-11-01T11:44:00 
Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and
will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad.

The Good:

On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous
Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and
for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live
bands. Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by
brining them into the show. It's something you can always expect from
these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a
show when they're in town.

On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful
Halloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and
bathroom walls, a couple beer spills, unnecessary  *** fights *** (CONFLICT) and the
expected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas. Naturally, I
dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was
having a good time. I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the
guests.

The Bad:

On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland;
effectively ending our chances at a national title this year. In
addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris
Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat. Alas, too little too
late was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been our
starter since  *** replacing *** (PERSONNEL) Rix earlier in the season. Fortunately the agony
of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have
to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday.

On Sunday we saw "Saw" (review coming) and as expected I was less
than satisfied. It was neither better nor worse than last week's "The
Grudge" but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year
and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror
movies. If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's
worth it.

They Refuse to Reason



 Scott 
 2004-11-01T18:06:00 
I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people  *** convene *** (CONTACT),
to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this
morning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong
target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to
tackle huge rises in  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) offences over the past few years,
according to an international firearms legislation expert.

Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as
Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the
law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane  *** massacre *** (CONFLICT),
were aberrations .

The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the
possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the
independent Fraser Institute in Canada. He has given evidence to select
committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted
the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.

His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day
in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour
Government  *** came to power *** (PERSONNEL) in 1997 . In the past two years, there have
been cases of schoolchildren and a baby,  *** killed *** (LIFE) or injured by guns.

"I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," he
said. "Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of
legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police
themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."

Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officers
are inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply with
regulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in a
firearms certificate form, will be  *** smuggling *** (MOVEMENT) a gun into the country or
selling one to an inner city youth."

Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the
year to June . Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham
and Manchester. It doesn't matter to these people that crime has
skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into
effect in Great Britain. Just as long as it's there, they feel safe.

Get Off Their Backs



 Scott 
 2004-11-16T13:47:00 
From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under
investigation for  *** killing *** (LIFE) a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in
Falluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable,
hair-trigger circumstances.

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the  *** shooting *** (CONFLICT) as a
scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during
the effort to quell the insurgency in the city.

"I can see why he would do it. He was probably running around being
 *** shot *** (CONFLICT) at for days on end in Falluja. There should be an investigation but
they should look into the circumstances," said Lance Corporal
Christopher Hanson.

"I would have  *** shot *** (LIFE) the insurgent too. Two shots to the head," said
Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. "You can't
trust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothing
wrong." Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this
story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in
question  *** lost *** (LIFE) a fellow soldier who was attending to a  *** dead *** (LIFE) insurgent
that was booby-trapped with explosives.

Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective
suicide  *** bombings *** (CONFLICT), and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn't
on the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines should
handle  *** dead *** (LIFE) and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure
their own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT)
either, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian
opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT) zones
from their comfortable recliners.

To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States:
You don't have to like our president or those operating this  ***  *** war *** (CONFLICT) *** (CONFLICT), but
get off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation
you will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends in
Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will
support them at every opportunity.

Not to be Ignored



 Scott 
 2004-12-01T23:13:00 
More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked
on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people  *** dead *** (LIFE),
and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.

I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the
issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and
everything that goes along with it. This is problem that needs to be
addressed.

But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man  *** accused *** (JUSTICE) of the
brutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul, Minn, used a Russian-built Saiga
7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.

As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of
banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain "assault weapons"
signed by President Clinton. The ban expired in September and at the
time of this posting, no one has been  *** killed *** (LIFE) by any one of those weapons
since the ban expired.

But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started
and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident. While
the media use words like "military style," "assault" and
"semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical
hunting rifle.

The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round
magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left
hand side of this blog. Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10
rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an "assault"
weapon. So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk
about the person behind the trigger.

If  *** convicted *** (JUSTICE) of the killings, Vang  *** faces *** (JUSTICE) life in prison as Minnesota
does not honor the death penalty. I look forward to Vang's conviction
and I pray for the families of the victims. What happened was
indefensible and justice must be served.

Life-Saving Disease



 Scott 
 2004-12-03T19:59:00 
Here's an incredible story about an unsung hero until now. From BBC
News : A retired Italian doctor has revealed for the first time how he
invented a fictitious disease which fooled the Nazis during World War
II. The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrified
the Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews.

Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th
anniversary of liberation of Rome. Just 28 years old at the time, he
used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death.

As other Jews were being rounded up, Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone who
could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a
dangerous disease.

"We would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering
from K Syndrome," he said. "We called it K after the German commander
Kesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis, and they
fled like rabbits."

K Syndrome saved his cousin, Luciana Sacerdoti, who was just 10 years
old.

"The day the Nazis  *** came *** (CONTACT) to the hospital, someone came to our room and
said: 'You have to cough, you have to cough a lot because they are
afraid of the coughing, they don't want to catch an awful disease and
they won't enter'."

It's Just Armor



 Scott 
 2004-12-08T21:33:00 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a  *** Q&A *** (CONTACT) with the
troops today that was anything but cozy. Disgruntled soldiers complained
to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and
other equipment. From the Associated Press : "You go to  *** war *** (CONFLICT) with the
Army you have," Rumsfeld replied, "not the Army you might want or wish
to have."

Spc. Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary, "Why do we
soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal
and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?" Shouts of
approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had
assembled to see Rumsfeld.

"We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north,"
Wilson, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., concluded after asking again.

Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental Combat
Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard, is about to  *** drive *** (MOVEMENT) north into
Iraq for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that has
bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year. Rarely, though, is it put
so bluntly in a public forum.

Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to  *** acquire *** (TRANSACTION) as
many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can. What is
more, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is.

"You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can
(still) be  *** blown up *** (CONFLICT)," he said. Can't say that's the most comforting
answer.

Protect Yourself Not in San Francisco



 Scott 
 2004-12-15T23:02:00 
From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on a
proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law
enforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.

If passed next November, residents would have 90 days to give up
firearms they keep in their homes or businesses. The proposal was
immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group.

Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards,
members of the military, and anyone else "actually employed and engaged
in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or
her employment," according to the measure.

Gun Owners of California, a Sacramento-based lobbying group, quickly
called the ban illegal. Sam Paredes, the group's executive director,
said state law bars local governments from usurping the state's
authority to regulate firearms.

"The amazing thing is they are going to turn San Francisco into
ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen
profession," Paredes said.

Washington, D.C., is the only major American city that currently bans
handgun possession by private citizens. Andrew Arulanandam, director of
public affairs for the National Rifle Association, said San Francisco
would be remiss to use that city as a model.

"If gun control worked, Washington, D.C., would be the beacon.
However, it's the  *** murder *** (LIFE) capital of the United States," he said.

If approved, the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006. Quote
of the day: "Firearms would be allowed only for police officers,
security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actually
employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life
within the scope of his or her employment."

So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and
protection of the home is not allowed. No thanks. If the people vote for
this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and
rape rates skyrocket, because burgulars will know homes are not guarded,
and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they
desire is their own inhibitions.

San Francisco is apparently bored with just being the gay capital of

Woman Charged With Murder, Kidnapping Fetus-Thingy



 Scott 
 2004-12-18T10:04:00 
From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been  *** cut out *** (LIFE) of her
mother's womb was found after a frantic search, and authorities  *** arrested *** (JUSTICE)
the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child. The baby
was in good condition Saturday.

Lisa M. Montgomery, 36, of Melvern, Kan., was arrested later Friday
and  *** charged *** (JUSTICE) with kidnapping resulting in  *** death *** (LIFE). Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23,
was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in
Skidmore, a town in northwest Missouri.

Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, had earlier been talking
with her mother on the  *** phone *** (CONTACT), and hung up saying a woman she had  *** chatted *** (CONTACT)
with online had just arrived at her door, authorities said.

U.S. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett through
an online message board, and authorities zeroed in on her using computer
forensics. Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett, who raised
rat terriers, he said.

According to the criminal complaint, Montgomery  *** traveled *** (MOVEMENT) about 40
miles to Topeka, Kan., on Thursday to go shopping. Her husband received
a  *** call *** (CONTACT) from her saying she had gone into labor and given  *** birth *** (LIFE). The next
day, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she  *** strangled *** (CONFLICT) Stinnett
from behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord.
I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from
a mother's womb a "child" or "girl" in a society that sanctions
partial- *** birth *** (LIFE) abortion. If you can't  *** charge *** (JUSTICE) someone for killing a fetus
via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big
deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the  *** knifing *** (CONFLICT).

On a less-sarcastic note, I pray for the family of the 23-year-old
woman. No one should have to  *** die *** (LIFE) because some crazy nut wanted a child
and decided to kill for it. If there's any good news in this story, it's
that Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother's memory. Question
for the pro-choicers: Being that it isn't yet the ninth month, can we
still  *** charge *** (JUSTICE) the killer with kidnapping?

Democrats Finally Getting it Right on Abortion?



 Scott 
 2004-12-23T14:49:00 
This is absolutely amazing news. Finally, the Democrats are finally
realizing that the American people support the rights of unborn children
and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values
that at least half of this country possesses. Of course, I'm sure the
Democrats would also like to start winning  ***  *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) *** (PERSONNEL) again. From the Los
Angeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of
abortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal
struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader
array of voters.

The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic
National, particularly between two leading candidates:  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Vermont
Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and  *** former *** (PERSONNEL) Indiana Rep.
Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound
from its losses in the November  *** election *** (PERSONNEL) unless it shows more tolerance
on one of society's most emotional conflicts. No Democrat with any
respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's name
again. The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his home
state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism.

Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which
 *** gives *** (TRANSACTION) a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've
got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.

Results from the last few  ***  *** elections *** (PERSONNEL) *** (PERSONNEL) suggest that wouldn't be such a
good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.

In the NFL

Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino's season touchdown record today with
49 against the San Diego Chargers in a thrilling game that ended in
overtime. I was happy to see Manning break the record, as last week he
decided to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when
he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a
touchdown. Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of
all time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.

On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White,  *** died *** (LIFE) of
heart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43. White played a
total of 15 years with Philadelphia, Green Bay and Carolina. He  *** retired *** (PERSONNEL)
after the 2000 season as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks with 198.
The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.

White will surely be missed.

Throw in the Towel

Perhaps Father Simpson was too busy telling reporters how hot he
thinks his daughter, Jessica, is to wake and up and realize that his
other daughter, Ashlee, is making a complete fool of herself.

Back in November I linked to this fraud's malfunctioned SNL
performance when a technical glitch caused the vocal track from her
first song to repeat during the second, proving she lip-synchs, even
though she has been quoted saying she doesn't.

The humiliation and assault-on-music continued last night, when for
some reason she decided to use her own voice in a wretched halftime
performance at the Orange Bowl which ended in a shower of boos. You can
see the video here if you can stand to watch a young no-talent wannabe
continue to humiliate herself in public.

The best thing Ms. Simpson can do at this point is to just stop
trying and end her music career. She has already made enough money from
her debut album (never again) to live out the rest of her life in some
secluded California mansion. There is nothing more to the story.
